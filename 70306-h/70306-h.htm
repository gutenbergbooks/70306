 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">iss Marjory’s</span> carefully planned
dinner was a marked success, and
was followed by a very pleasant
evening, spent partly in the sweet, old-fashioned
and faultlessly kept garden, and
partly in the cool, softly lighted drawing-room.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory’s guest and deputy landlord
made himself most agreeable. He talked
politics and science with Miss Marjory, told
anecdotes and traveller’s tales to Ethel, and
discussed town talk with Horace, who had
not long left London for Whitbury.</p>

<p>When Tor reached his room that night, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
was with the consciousness that he had made
at least one valuable friend, but at the same
time with the fear that his position was
gradually growing less and less secure.
Troublesome reflections would crowd into
his mind, and it was anything but a pleasant
possibility that loomed before him, the thought
that he might be branded as a felon and taste
the sweets of convict-life! That would be
rather a heavy penalty to pay for the fraud
he had practised for friendship’s sake; and
yet it was just possible that an adverse fate
might drive matters even to such a crisis as
that. What then would become of his intended
proposal to Maud? She would be as
hopelessly beyond his reach as if she were the
wife of Lewis Belassis. The reflection was
not inspiriting, but Tor shook himself,
‘pulled himself together,’ and smiled at his
own depression.</p>

<p>‘Never say die! What can have come to
me? There’s no reason why I should be
betrayed, or betray myself. Old Belassis will
have enough on his hands, I should say, after
my hints, without trying to upset my claim.
I wonder what Miss Marjory knows about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
him. I must have some more conversation
with her to-morrow. She is a clever woman,
I am sure; and will, I think, stand my
friend.’</p>

<p>So Tor argued himself out of his fears, and
soon regained his customary elasticity of
spirit. He slept soundly, and woke in a
happier frame of mind.</p>

<p>He and Miss Marjory made the breakfast-table
very lively; and when she requested
him to make a tour of inspection round house
and gardens, Ethel and Horace smiled at one
another, and said that Cousin Marjory had
evidently made a conquest, and would have
no trouble in getting her own way with the
landlord, even were her demands more exorbitant
than they were known to be.</p>

<p>Very brisk and business-like did Miss
Marjory show herself as she conducted ‘Mr.
Debenham’ round ‘his friend’s’ property.
No smallest allusion did she make to what
had passed between them on the previous
afternoon, but confined herself exclusively to
the matter in hand. She showed what had
been done in house and garden since her
father had taken out the lease, explained what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
she wanted done now, and discussed with him
what she considered to be her share of the
undertaking, and what she believed the landlord
should be ready to do. Her demands
were both just and reasonable, and Tor
assented readily to all she proposed, and
would have even done more, only that Miss
Marjory checked him.</p>

<p>‘Oh no, thank you. I don’t wish to be
extortionate; and besides, that would be
wasteful. I don’t say but what the stables
might have been better arranged originally;
but they have done very well for us these
twenty-eight years, and will do so till the
end of the chapter. There’s no end to the
expense when once you begin to dabble in
bricks and mortar; and if you take my advice
you’ll let the matter alone. I’ve told you
what I want—the well, and the iron fencing,
and general outside repairs. You will have
to spend a good deal over those. Don’t run
into needless expense.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Miss Marjory, I will be guided by
your judgment; but you have done so much
yourself, that it would be shabby of me
not to be willing to meet you more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
half-way. Look at all the glass you have
put up.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; that’s my hobby. I can’t do without
flowers; and when you once begin, you
must go on. There’s no end to what one
wants. I should like to have seven acres of
glass, like Veitch.’</p>

<p>‘And overlook all yourself, Miss Marjory?’
asked Tor, with a smile.</p>

<p>‘Yes, of course. I always do want my
finger in everybody’s pie. I suppose you
think I couldn’t do it—an old woman like
me.’</p>

<p>‘I have a very strong impression that you
could do anything you’ve a mind to, Miss
Marjory,’ answered Tor; and Miss Marjory
laughed and shook her head at him in implied
rebuke.</p>

<p>‘Trying to practise on the credulity of an
old woman, Mr. Debenham. As if I did not
know all your tricks by heart—idle young
good-for-nothings! Come now, we have not
quite done our business yet. I have told my
factotum tradesman to meet you here to-day,
to give you a sort of general estimate as to
time and cost. You will find him a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
honest and capable man, this Alfred Belassis,
and you cannot do better than employ him.’</p>

<p>Tor’s eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>‘What name did you say?’</p>

<p>‘Alfred Belassis; he is quite our model
tradesman in Whitbury, for anything in the
building line, within or without—a capital
workman, though still young.’</p>

<p>Tor was looking hard at Miss Marjory.</p>

<p>‘Alfred Belassis!’ he said slowly. ‘Alfred
Belassis! How very curious!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is rather curious, isn’t it?’ said
Miss Marjory coolly; ‘the same name as that
uncle of your friend’s—of yours, I mean—of
whom you think so highly. He will be here
shortly, and my advice to you is—<i>look well at
him</i>.’</p>

<p>The significance of the last four words
convinced Tor that Miss Marjory knew, or
suspected, more than a mere coincidence in
this identity of names; but no more was said
then, for the said Alfred Belassis was already
approaching them, having been directed by
the servants to the spot where Miss Marjory
and the landlord were consulting together.</p>

<p>The talk that followed was chiefly carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
on between the tradesman and Miss Marjory,
Tor contenting himself by assenting
to what was proposed, and throwing in an
observation from time to time for form’s sake.
He followed Miss Marjory’s advice to the
letter, however, and looked well at Belassis,
bestowing such careful scrutiny upon him as
would have astonished him, had he been made
aware of it.</p>

<p>Yes, Tor was quite convinced that there
was some vague likeness between this young
builder and Philip’s Uncle Belassis. There
was something similar in build and in voice;
and several little tricks of manner were
strongly alike. The younger man was a far
pleasanter specimen of humanity, quiet, civil,
and unassuming, yet thoroughly up to his
work, and able to grasp Miss Marjory’s meaning,
and even to make notes, in spite of her
rapid delivery, which puzzled Tor more than
once.</p>

<p>So he watched attentively, and the conviction
became stronger, and a sense of vague
bewilderment grew up, as he traced more and
more of the Belassis form and colouring in
this Whitbury tradesman who bore their name.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
What it could all mean, he was at a loss to
imagine.</p>

<p>When Belassis was gone, Miss Marjory
turned round with something of triumph in
her tone.</p>

<p>‘Well, and what do you say to that?
What have you made out there?’</p>

<p>‘He must come of the same stock, I think,’
said Tor slowly. ‘He certainly is rather like
my uncle, unless my fancy has deceived
me.’</p>

<p>‘I do not imagine that it has,’ said Miss
Marjory significantly.</p>

<p>‘You believe he belongs to that family?’
asked Tor. ‘I have never heard of him!’</p>

<p>‘Probably not.’</p>

<p>‘You think, as a poor relation, he has been
kept in the background purposely?’</p>

<p>‘Alfred Belassis is by no means a poor man.
He is very well-to-do in the world.’</p>

<p>‘But still in trade.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, in trade; but do you think a wealthy
man, even in trade, would be quite beneath
Alfred Belassis’ notice?’</p>

<p>‘I see you know more than I do, Miss
Marjory,’ said Tor, the feeling of perplexity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
growing slowly upon him. ‘Won’t you
confide in me now, and tell me what it
is?’</p>

<p>‘Come into the shrubbery, then, where we
can talk uninterrupted. I do not know much,
but I suspect a good deal. Perhaps we can
piece it together.’</p>

<p>Tor followed her, wondering, but not seeing
the end. Was this what she meant by
‘putting a spoke in Belassis’ wheel’?</p>

<p>‘Now,’ said Miss Marjory, seating herself
upon a rustic chair, and bidding Tor follow
her example. ‘I suppose, as you are a man,
you don’t see an inch before your nose as yet?
Men never do.’</p>

<p>Tor was forced to admit that he didn’t.</p>

<p>‘Now, who do you suppose was the father
of that young man?’</p>

<p>‘Was it a brother of Belassis?—a brother
who made a low marriage and was cast off,
and never heard of more? That’s what I
fancy must have taken place.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you might have made a worse shot,’
returned Miss Marjory indulgently. However,
you haven’t quite got to the rights of it
yet, as you will see when I tell you that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
father’s name was the same as the son’s—Alfred
Belassis.’</p>

<p>‘Alfred Belassis!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Alfred Belassis, brothers are not
usually called by the same name.’</p>

<p>‘A cousin?’ suggested Tor feebly; but
Miss Marjory cut him ruthlessly short.</p>

<p>‘Cousin, indeed! Don’t make yourself out
denser than you are! I believe you have
grasped the situation now.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean that you think he is my
uncle’s son?’ quoth Tor. ‘Impossible!’</p>

<p>‘I believe he is Philip Debenham’s uncle’s
son, most assuredly; and so will you too, if you
will only listen to me.’</p>

<p>‘But has he, then, a right to his name?’
Tor could not help asking. ‘Do you mean
that Belassis has been twice married?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, he was married fast enough. Mr.
Longmore married them—my pretty waiting-maid,
Nelly Roberts, and that young loafer
Alfred Belassis, whom we none of us knew,
and none of us liked. But they would go
their own way, and nobody could hinder the
marriage. Nelly was one-and-twenty, and he
a little older. He made out that he was well-to-do,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
and would make a lady of her; and her
silly head was turned, and they got married, and
lived for a few months at the Angler’s Arms,
where he had been stopping for the fishing.
And then one fine morning he got some letters
from home, he told her, and must go away
for a few days on business. He left no
address, saying he would write when he
reached his destination, and she was too
confiding to ask questions. He went away in
gay good spirits, and never returned again;
nor did any word or message from him ever
reach her from that day forward.’</p>

<p>‘The scoundrel!’ muttered Tor.</p>

<p>‘So we all said,’ assented Miss Marjory—‘all
but Nelly, who was convinced that some evil
chance had befallen him. There had been a bad
coaching accident somewhere in the country on
the day he had left her, and she was fully persuaded
that he had been killed in it. Nobody
else believed this theory, for we had none of
us liked the young man, who was vulgar and
pretentious, without having anything to recommend
him. I told Nelly that no doubt
his movements could be traced, and her suspicion
either verified or overthrown; and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
if he was still living he could be made to
support her. But her pride revolted against
such a course. She showed what I considered
a very proper spirit, and said that if he had
left her of his own free will, he might leave
her. She would never force herself where she
was not wanted, and make him support her,
now that he was tired of her, and despised her
love. If he was dead, as she believed,
search would be useless; and if not, she would
still not have him found. He could come
back to her of his own accord if he would; if
not, he might stay away, and she would never
trouble him more. We Whitbury people
believed she had judged wisely for herself—such
a marriage could only end in unhappiness—and
we all pitied and helped her, for she
was an orphan, poor child, and had no relatives
in the neighbourhood.’</p>

<p>Tor was listening intently, an uncomfortable
feeling growing up in his mind.</p>

<p>‘Did she live long?’ he asked. ‘I suppose
she is not alive now?’</p>

<p>‘No. She lived several years though, and
brought up her little boy, Alfred, well and
respectably; but when he was about four or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
five years old, as nearly as I can remember,
her health failed very much, and the charge of
the child became more of a burden than she
could undertake. I found a home for the
boy in an institution, where he would be well
cared for, and taught a useful trade; and his
mother, quite satisfied, went to live with some
relatives in the South of England, who had
offered her a home. I heard from her from
time to time, and then I went abroad for a
couple of years, during which period her
letters quite ceased. When I came back, and
could make inquiries, I found out that she had
died, though how and when, I do not exactly
know.’</p>

<p><i>When</i> she had died was, in Tor’s mind, an
important point. Miss Marjory and he were
both thinking the same thing.</p>

<p>‘Do you know when your uncle’s second
marriage took place?’ asked Miss Marjory
abruptly.</p>

<p>‘I have been considering—I think it must
have been in or very much about the year
1850.’</p>

<p>‘Nelly Belassis was living in November,
1849,’ remarked Miss Marjory—‘living, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
in fair health, for I heard from her then. I
do not know how long she lived afterwards.’</p>

<p>‘But surely Belassis knew,’ said Tor. ‘He
is a villain, and a clumsy villain, too; but I
think he knows better than to perpetrate
bigamy. He must have kept his eye upon
her, and verified her death.’</p>

<p>‘It is possible, of course; but I do not
know how he managed it, if he did. Nelly
never heard one syllable from him during the
years that followed the desertion, and you may
be sure he would not let his face be seen in
Whitbury. He had left too many bad debts
behind him, perpetrated too many questionable
actions, in addition to his conduct towards
poor Nelly, ever to care to appear here
again in a hurry. When Nelly left, I believe
nobody but myself knew whither she had
gone; so that, even if he did start an inquiry
after her, there is every probability he would
have been baffled. It is my very firm impression
that he just looked upon his doings here
as a crop of wild oats that he had sown in his
youth; and trusted to the thousand and one
chances of life, that if ever there came to be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
harvest, it would not be his hand that would
reap it.’</p>

<p>Tor thought this supposition quite in keeping
with the clumsy rascality of Belassis, as he
had seen it. He had no opinion at all of Phil’s
uncle’s capacity. His wife’s shrewdness and
his own dogged determination and brazen dishonesty
had carried him safely on so far, when
not opposed by any far-seeing or strong-minded
foe; but he could quite believe him
capable of running a tremendous risk rather
than lose a present opportunity of good, or
face a distinctly awkward position.</p>

<p>‘You may be right,’ he said slowly. ‘He
is a pitiful coward, and as covetous as Judas.
I suppose to have acknowledged such a
marriage would have ruined his prospects for
life.’</p>

<p>‘Just so. I imagine his father would have
had scant mercy, if it had come to his ears.’</p>

<p>‘If Belassis takes after his father, I should
say he would.’</p>

<p>There was a pause for reflection.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you do not know much of this
uncle’s past history?’</p>

<p>‘No, little enough. The real Phil might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
know more, perhaps, though I don’t think it
would come to much. I could find out,
though, I dare say.’</p>

<p>‘From whom?’</p>

<p>‘From Mrs. Lorraine, my aunt <i>pro tem</i>.
Mrs. Belassis’ sister, and Mrs. Debenham’s.’</p>

<p>‘From what you tell me of your mother’s
family—I mean, of course, Mr. Debenham’s
mother’s family—they seem very well born
people—quite superior to the Belassis’.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, quite, I should say.’</p>

<p>‘Then what made one of the sisters marry
Alfred Belassis?’</p>

<p>‘That I don’t know, but I might find out.’</p>

<p>‘Do so if you can. Of course, a match like
that would be an immense advantage to a man
in his position; one can understand that if
such a thing as that were in view, he would
be reluctant enough to confess his former
marriage with a lady’s-maid. I wonder if
Nelly was dead at the time, and if he knew it.
Mr. Debenham, unless you can make sure of
that fact, don’t let your sister marry Lewis
Belassis on any account.’</p>

<p>‘I will not,’ said Tor resolutely.</p>

<p>‘You must find out the exact date of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
wedding, and I will endeavour to find out that
of Nelly’s death. Unluckily, as all these
things happened more than a quarter of a
century ago, I am doubtful if I have even a
record left of the place the poor girl went to.
It was Devonshire or Dorsetshire, I think,
but I can be sure of nothing. Still, I will do
my best; where there’s a will there’s a way.
And I think you have now another hold upon
your worthy uncle.’</p>

<p>‘I think so,’ answered Tor, with some
satisfaction in his tone. ‘If I wish to be
specially agreeable to him, or if he has been
particularly pleasant to me, I can tell him that
I have been over to Whitbury, and ask him if
he has any knowledge of the place.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory seemed to enjoy the idea of
this question very much.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Whitbury must recall many very
pleasant associations; for, as I tell you, he
sowed plenty of wild oats here before he spoilt
poor Nelly’s life. Mr. Graves could, I fancy,
lay his hands upon some papers which would
be rather disconcerting to a man of his social
standing. You could ask him if he remembers
the lawyer Mr. Graves, or Miss Marjory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Descartes. I should like to see his face if you
did!’</p>

<p>‘Did he know you, then?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, he knew me well enough to come and
beg my intercession with Mr. Graves, for his
poor dear Nelly’s sake. I was a silly young
thing in those days, with more money than
wisdom; and I was fond of Nelly, and did
not want her to know what a precious sort of
fellow this husband of hers was. So I gave
him money, and got him off somehow; but I
don’t imagine his gratitude would teach him
to welcome me very warmly now.’</p>

<p>Tor smiled to himself.</p>

<p>‘I could go on to sing your praises, and to
assert my hope that some day I might see you
at Ladywell. May I really hope that you will
visit us there one of these days?’</p>

<p>‘I’ll come if you want me—if things are
going badly with you, and a curb is wanted
for Belassis. I’ll come if my support will be
of service to you; but I don’t often pay visits
for pleasure. I always find that I wish myself
home again in two days’ time.’</p>

<p>‘I trust you may not do that if you come
to Ladywell,’ said Tor gallantly. ‘Such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
promise almost makes a complication and
danger desirable.’</p>

<p>‘Stuff and nonsense! don’t talk rubbish
to an old woman like me. I’ll come if I’m
needed; and if not, I’ll stay at home. But
don’t you be rash and drive Belassis to bay,
or he might turn upon you. I’d advise you
to say nothing about the kinsman you’ve
found here.’</p>

<p>‘I shall not at present, at any rate. I have
no wish to drive things to a crisis; but I
think I shall be able to guess by his manner
whether or not he knew of his first wife’s
death, before his second marriage. I hope it
is all right. I don’t want, for the sake of wife
and children, to drag up anything that would
fall so hardly upon them; but I don’t care
how much of a dog’s life I lead Belassis.’</p>

<p>‘He deserves it all,’ cried Miss Marjory,
with energy; ‘only be careful.’</p>

<p>‘I will. I live in a glass house myself;
but I shall certainly hold you over his head
if he becomes objectionable.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you may do that. I rather like an
encounter of wits myself. In the days of my
youth I was a good hand at retort. I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
think my tongue has quite lost its cunning
even now.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think so either,’ smiled Tor. ‘Yes,
we must certainly contrive a meeting, face to
face.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory would make no definite
promise, but Tor went away convinced that
he had gained a valuable ally, and one who
would never desert him, and who would,
perhaps, be more dangerous to Belassis than
he himself could be.</p>

<p>There was something in Miss Marjory’s
assured position and in the respect which she
always inspired, as well as in her age and
experience, which was very encouraging to the
young man, who certainly needed all the
advantages he could secure; and he was now
exceedingly glad that the lease of his house
had fallen in, and that Miss Marjory had summoned
him to Whitbury.</p>

<small>MRS. BELASSIS VISITS LADYWELL.</small></h2>
</div>


<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"
  src="images/i_pi.jpg" alt="I" ></div>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">t</span> was on a Tuesday morning that
Maud said good-bye to her brother,
and saw him set out for Yorkshire;
and on the Wednesday morning, whilst riding
out through the great avenue, she was surprised
to see her Aunt Celia, walking in her
resolute way up to the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis seldom visited Ladywell, and
never before had she been there at so unseasonable
an hour. Maud looked wonderingly
at her, and stopped her horse, as she met the
business-like figure.</p>

<p>‘Do you want anybody, Aunt Celia?’ she
asked. ‘You will only find Aunt Olive at
home. Phil has gone into Yorkshire, but he
will be back this evening. Can I do anything
for you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>‘Your brother is away, is he?’ asked Mrs.
Belassis, as though surprised. In reality she
was perfectly well aware of the fact. Had her
nephew been at home, she would not have
taken the trouble to pay this visit.</p>

<p>‘Yes; but he comes back to-night. Can I
give him any message?’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis seemed to consider.</p>

<p>‘Well, as I am so near I will go on and
see your Aunt Olive,’ she said indifferently.
‘I had a question I wished to ask Philip; but
that can wait. I will not interrupt you,
my dear. I hope you will have a pleasant
ride.’</p>

<p>Maud rode on, a disdainful look crossing
her pretty face.</p>

<p>‘I wonder if Aunt Celia is up to anything,’
she mused. ‘She generally is when she
smiles and says “my dear,” and puts on her
gracious air. How I do loathe Aunt Celia!
I do believe she is worse than Uncle Belassis.
I am afraid she is Phil’s enemy—not that that
matters much, for she couldn’t do him any
harm. Sometimes I fancy Phil has something
on his mind; but I don’t see that he need. I
wonder why he said yesterday that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
sure Aunt Olive and I would always stand
his friends, through thick and thin. I should
think I just would!’ and Maud’s eyes flashed.
‘I’d stand by him whatever happened—whatever
he’d said or done, or whatever people
said of him. There’s nobody like my Phil.
I love his little finger better than all the rest
of the world put together. If ever he is in
any danger, won’t I show him how I love
him!’</p>

<p>Maud’s whole face glowed, and she urged
her horse to a gallop in her generous enthusiasm,
and rode far and fast that day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis walked boldly up to the
house. She did not ring the bell, although
she was on anything but intimate terms with
the household at Ladywell; she preferred to
walk straight into the great hall, where she
paused and looked about her.</p>

<p>Nobody was in sight. Neither manservant
nor maidservant, bond nor free, had observed
her entrance, and with a certain snake-like
look of satisfaction, she quietly crossed the
hall, and entered a small room which looked
over the garden, and which generally went by
the name of ‘Phil’s den.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Once inside this room, she closed the door
softly and stealthily, and looked for a moment
as though she would have locked it too; but
on second thoughts she seemed to decide
against doing so, and muttering, ‘It might
look suspicious if anyone should come,’ turned
away.</p>

<p>The room was not large, and was furnished
quite in bachelor fashion, with a shabby but
luxuriously easy leather chair, a multitude
of pipes and cigar-boxes; one small table
beside the easy-chair, which was strewn with
newspapers and smoking apparatus, and a
large writing-table full of drawers which stood
in the window. The walls were adorned by
guns and fishing-tackle, and by some engravings
which showed greater taste for art,
and less for sport, than do most bachelors’
pictures. It was a snug, cosy room; and the
presence of a second and much daintier armchair,
in the opposite corner, seemed to indicate
that Maud liked at times to be her
brother’s ‘den companion.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis’ keen eye took all this in
at a glance. She saw in a moment where
lay her work, and she seated herself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
a quiet business-like way at the writing-table.</p>

<p>‘It will be rather odd,’ she muttered to
herself, ‘if amongst all his papers I do not
find something to give me a clue, if there
is anything wrong, and I’m not generally
deceived when I take an idea into my
head.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis set to work in a methodical
way. She began with the small drawers at
the top of the table, and turned the contents
rapidly over, spreading out the papers and
glancing quickly over them. She did not
seem to find anything of any interest amongst
these, and in ten minutes that part of her
search was completed.</p>

<p>It was with greater deliberation that she
commenced to open the larger drawers on
either side of her; and her face was more set,
her eyes more curious than ever, as this task
proceeded.</p>

<p>First came papers and memoranda connected
with the Ladywell property, bills, receipts,
correspondence as to cattle, hay, poultry, and
the thousand and one transactions necessitated
by a farm and estate. Tor was not a specially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
orderly man, but he had a method of classification
with his papers, which enabled him
to lay his hand readily upon anything he
wanted.</p>

<p>A few minutes’ study convinced Mrs.
Belassis that there was nothing to be gained
by a minute inspection of these papers, so
they were replaced in their drawer, and the
next one opened.</p>

<p>This contained private bills and correspondence,
and Mrs. Belassis looked as if she
anticipated considerable information from the
heap of papers she drew out.</p>

<p>‘Extravagant!’ she muttered more than
once; a dark look crossing her face as she
came across receipted bills for dresses, jewellery,
and finery of all kinds for Maud, and handsome
silks and laces, in which she knew her
sister Olive had appeared.</p>

<p>Still, amongst all these bills and papers
she did not seem to find what she wanted,
although more than enough to annoy and
anger her. The letters were all addressed to
‘Philip Debenham, Esq.,’ and were for the
most part petitions from charitable institutions,
notices from picture-dealers, or offers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
of everything for nothing from companies and
tradespeople.</p>

<p>These papers were replaced in their drawer,
and the search continued.</p>

<p>The third drawer upon that side was
locked, so with rather a significant smile
Mrs. Belassis tried the first on the next side.
This opened readily enough, but merely contained
a supply of writing-paper, envelopes,
stamps, and pens, which, by its orderly
appearance, seemed to have been given over to
Maud’s willing care. The drawer below contained
the farm-books, the garden-book and
the stable-book, which had been kept with
scrupulous exactness by old Mr. Maynard,
and which his successor had taken some
apparent pains to keep in their old accuracy
under a new <i>régime</i>.</p>

<p>The third drawer, again, was locked.</p>

<p>‘These must be the two that I want,’ said
Mrs. Belassis under her breath; and again she
glanced towards the door, as though she would
have liked to lock it, but considered it more
prudent to abstain.</p>

<p>A looker-on might have been tempted to
wonder how Mrs. Belassis proposed to get at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the contents of those locked drawers. Was
she going to force the locks? Not at all.
Whatever her husband might be, Mrs. Belassis
was never clumsy. What she undertook to
do, was done neatly, and even artistically.</p>

<p>Ladies of some social standing do not
usually visit their friends’ houses with
skeleton-keys hidden away in their pockets;
but it was nothing more nor less than this
useful little implement that Mrs. Belassis
drew out now; and with the snake-like look
more visible than ever in her eyes, she set
about her task.</p>

<p>Kneeling down upon the floor, she soon
had the first drawer open, and had taken
from thence the documents it held.</p>

<p>There was Phil’s cheque-book first of all,
and then a few papers folded and held together
by an elastic band. There was a bag, which
evidently held some money, and behind all
these some papers and relics, which were
evidently all that had come to him from the
effects of the father and mother. Belassis had
taken care that such mementoes should be but
few.</p>

<p>The cheque-book first claimed Mrs. Belassis’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
earnest attention. She studied the counterfoils
closely, and then began comparing the
sums with the amounts upon the bills she
had previously found. Naturally they corresponded
accurately enough; but what Mrs.
Belassis noticed was this, that for at least
six bills (all presents for Maud) which were
specified to have been settled ‘by cheque,’ no
counterfoil was to be found: and this fact
seemed significant of something, though of
what she could not yet say.</p>

<p>Next the family relics were contemptuously
turned over, and put back in their place,
and Mrs. Belassis now commenced the
study of the papers enclosed by the elastic
band.</p>

<p>There were but two of them after all,
though one was of a bulk and importance
that gave it the substance of half a dozen
ordinary letters. The crabbed characters were
familiar to her eye, and it did not need the
colossal signature ‘T. M. Maynard’ to tell
her that it had been penned by her late uncle,
the former master of Ladywell.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, nothing less than the dead
man’s letter to his nephew, Philip Debenham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
which Tor had read in the little hotel at
Hornberg.</p>

<p>With a subdued exclamation of curiosity
and satisfaction, Mrs. Belassis sat down to
read the document; and as she did so, her
face assumed an expression not at all agreeable
to look upon. She read the paper not
once, but twice; and the venomous expression
deepened upon her face, until it grew positively
hideous in its intensity.</p>

<p>Then she turned the paper over and over, and
opened out its stiff folds, although the writing
had only occupied the first page, and in so
doing her attention was caught by a few
pencilled words written on the inside, as if
by an afterthought. And she was convinced
by the manner in which the paper opened,
that hers had been the first hand which had
unfolded it. An eager yet dark look crossed
her face, as she took in the sense of that after-message.</p>

<p>‘Your father once gave me to understand
that he had drawn up a more equitable will,
and had hidden it away somewhere in my
library. I told him he had better take it out
and give it to a lawyer to keep. And I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
he must have taken it out—and destroyed it;
for I never could find it, though I took the
trouble to make a thorough search. He was
just a muddler with his affairs, and a dreamer
too. You may be sure he made away with
the will in a moment of weakness; but of
course if you choose to search for it, you
can—you won’t find it.’</p>

<p>As she took in the import of these words,
Mrs. Belassis fairly trembled. The anger
which had disfigured her face before, gave way
now to a look more nearly approaching terror;
and then, after a few minutes of deep thought,
she folded the paper once more and put it in
her pocket.</p>

<p>‘I will show it to Alfred. He must see it.
Then the pencilled words shall be erased, and
I will take an early opportunity to return the
paper. There are a hundred chances to one
that it will not be missed. Now for the other.’</p>

<p>The other was Maud’s eager letter to her
brother, written to him at Hornberg, to
announce her delight and eager anticipation.
The terms in which it was couched were not
calculated to soothe Mrs. Belassis, and a look
of bitter hatred crossed her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>‘The little reptile, the little toad—making
mischief from the very first! Oh, but I will
be even with her! She shall learn to rue the
day when first she tried to poison her brother’s
minds against us—putting all sorts of suspicions
into his head. Faugh! the ingratitude
of the little viper!’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis folded the letter, and flung it
into the drawer after the other things, and
then she viciously locked it. Her mind was
so much disturbed by her late discoveries, that
she was almost tempted to pursue her researches
no further, confident that she had
found the most important papers in existence.
But the dogged stubbornness of her character
prevailed over her preoccupation and dismay,
and she remembered that although she had
found something of the greatest importance,
she had not found anything of the character she
had hoped—nothing to compromise her nephew,
or to verify the very dim suspicion that had
entered into her head. What that suspicion
was she would have found it hard to say; all
that she told even herself as yet was that there
was ‘something odd’ about Phil, and that she
believed there was ‘some mystery’ going on.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
So far, however, she had found nothing to
encourage such an idea, and with a certain
sense of having been baffled, she opened the
sixth and last drawer.</p>

<p>There were not many papers here; but
there was a second cheque-book, and upon the
inside of the cover was written ‘Tor’s cheque-book.’
There was also a bank-book labelled
‘Torrington Torwood, Esq.;’ and rapid reference
to the former showed Mrs. Belassis that
the missing counterfoils of cheques she knew
to have been written by Phil, were to be found,
not in his, but in Mr. Torwood’s cheque-book.</p>

<p>This was something of a facer, and she felt
a triumphant joy in finding anything so like
a mystery. She did not pause now to try and
unravel it, but passed on to the other contents
of the drawer.</p>

<p>There were two letters from a certain
‘Marjory Descartes,’ asking Phil to go over to
‘Whitbury’ to settle some business for Mr.
Torwood, and there were one or two business
communications from agents or bankers,
referring to Phil some question about Mr.
Torwood’s affairs. These were read with a
certain sense of disappointment, as they seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
to show that Phil was openly acting as his
friend’s agent; but hope rose again when a
deeper dive into the drawer brought out a little
packet of papers, some quite old and yellow,
which proved to be I O U’s for various sums,
all signed ‘Philip Debenham.’</p>

<p>‘Moneys Mr. Torwood lent him, evidently,’
mused Mrs. Belassis. ‘Oh, then Phil’s friend
was not quite so disinterested, after all, as we
were led to think. I thought there was something
odd about it. But how comes Phil to
have these papers now? There is no evidence
that he has redeemed them. It is a large sum—nearly
£3,000, I should say. His cheque-book
shows no mention of Mr. Torwood, and
I should have heard from Alfred, I think, if
he had handed over any very large sum
whilst the securities were being settled. I
don’t understand why he keeps them if they
are redeemed, and why he has not a receipt
for the amount if it is paid. If not, how
comes he by the papers at all?’</p>

<p>Certainly, what with one thing and what
with another, Mrs. Belassis had ample food
for meditation; but she had stayed so long
that she feared to linger. She locked up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
drawer, and was preparing to leave, when
Maud came suddenly in, in her riding-habit.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Celia, you here!’ she exclaimed.
‘Have you been here all this while? Aunt
Olive says she has never even seen you.
What can you have been doing all this time?
Two whole hours!’</p>

<p>Maud looked both excited and suspicious.
This was her house, and she was mistress; and
she considered that her Aunt Celia had taken a
great liberty in making her way in unobserved,
and shutting herself up in Phil’s den. Her
face showed as much very plainly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis looked at her with her cold
smile.</p>

<p>‘Do not act and speak like a spoilt child,
my dear. It is not becoming to a young
mistress. I fear you are forgetting the lessons
I instilled into your mind at Thornton House.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, there is no fear of my forgetting your
lessons or Thornton House either,’ cried Maud,
with what sounded very like defiance in her
tone. ‘But I hope I have shaken off the
effects of that yoke. What I want to know
is, why you have been shut up in Phil’s room
for two hours—in his <i>private</i> room.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis looked at the indignant Maud
with a smile of cool disdain.</p>

<p>‘As this is your brother’s house, over
which you preside, I will condescend to reply,
otherwise I should decline to answer such
an insolent interrogation. After I left you I
made a tour of the gardens and hot-houses,
which I am never invited to inspect, of course,
owing to the kind politeness of the mistress
of Ladywell. After I had enjoyed the sweetness
of the flowers and trees for above an
hour, I came here to write a note to Philip;
but what I wrote did not satisfy me, and I
tore up the letter and determined to wait till I
could see him personally. Just as I was about
to leave the room my niece entered, and here
we are now, face to face. Are you satisfied?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ answered Maud; ‘but I
hear what you say. Are you going? Good-bye.
If you care to see Aunt Olive she is in
the drawing-room. We shall have lunch in
an hour.’</p>

<p>‘I will go home, thank you,’ said Mrs.
Belassis coldly. ‘Good-bye, my dear.’</p>

<p>Maud watched her cross the hall, a distrustful
and angry light in her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>‘She always gets the best of it with me. I
can never be politely cutting to Aunt Celia, as
Phil is. I am always rude, and she makes me
feel like a schoolgirl. How I detest her! I
wonder why she came. I know what she
said was all lies. What can she have been
up to? I wonder what that letter to Phil
was that she wrote and destroyed. Did she
write a letter at all?’ Maud went forward
and carefully looked about for torn fragments
of paper, but could find none.</p>

<p>‘If she wrote it she took it away in her
pocket,’ said Maud; and then she opened the
ink-bottle and saw that it had been washed
out that morning and not refilled. Mrs.
Belassis had certainly written no letter there
that day. What she had done, the girl was
at a loss to imagine. All that she could tell
was that her aunt’s visit was certain to mean
mischief of some kind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis had ample food for reflection
on her homeward way, and very earnestly did
she strive to form some theory as to the
respective position of Phil and his friend, so
as to prove, if possible, that the former was
acting in a reprehensible manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>At last an idea was hit upon which seemed
to satisfy her; at any rate, it gave a semblance
of reality to her suspicions.</p>

<p>‘I believe he has got his friend shut up in
a lunatic asylum somewhere—unless he has
put him out of the way altogether; and he
is playing a double game—sometimes Torwood
and sometimes himself. I suppose he
was Torwood abroad, whilst he was the rich
man; and here he is Debenham; thus reaping
the benefits of both characters. Perhaps Mr.
Torwood’s mind has been failing of late, so
that he has learned to depend upon Philip;
yes, that is very likely. And now that he
has money of his own, he has just disposed
of his friend anyhow—no doubt in a madhouse—and
is figuring about here as a great
man, and spending his friend’s money as well
as his own. Oh, you’re a nice young man,
Philip Debenham! No wonder you keep
your friend at a distance, and don’t trouble
yourself about him. No wonder nobody can
get to know anything definite about the
“Tor” who was once all your talk. A very
nice thing it will be for you when I bring
it home to you! Oh yes, you will enjoy that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
very much; and I wonder what the law will
say to these little transactions with Torwood’s
money;’ and in this strain Mrs. Belassis kept
on, her spirits rising and her confidence in
her theory increasing with every step she
took. But when she felt in her pocket, and
her hand came in contact with the stiff paper
it held, her face changed suddenly, and the
old look of rage and fear returned.</p>

<p>‘If old Maynard is right, if there is another
will, and if that will is ever found—then we
shall be ruined! Why did I ever marry such
a fool as Alfred Belassis? I could do anything
if it were not for his clumsiness!’</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">or</span> did not return to Ladywell until
late at night, having missed a
train at one of the junctions, where
his cross route obliged him to change.</p>

<p>Maud, therefore, said nothing to him about
Mrs. Belassis’ strange behaviour until the
following afternoon, when they rode out
together, and then she told him as much as
she knew of this oddly-timed visit.</p>

<p>‘Wanted to see me, did she?’ said Tor. ‘I
wonder what for. I’ll call at Thornton House
this evening and ask. I can walk over after
dinner.’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, don’t!’ cried Maud coaxingly.
‘The evenings are so dull without you.
Never mind Aunt Celia. She is quite horrid.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
Let her come again if she wants you. I
believe it was just a lie.’</p>

<p>‘Come, little sister, don’t be spiteful. I
know Mrs. Belassis does not greatly love
either of us, still we must be civil as long
as we can, or we put ourselves at a disadvantage.’</p>

<p>‘I know I do,’ assented Maud. ‘I can’t
manage as you do; I wish I could. She
would give anything to be able to put you
into a rage as she puts me; but she never
can.’</p>

<p>Tor smiled calmly.</p>

<p>‘Just so; and I have no intention of affording
her that gratification.’</p>

<p>‘It must be nice to be a man—a man like
you, I mean,’ said Maud, regarding him with
a loving admiration distinctly flattering to its
object. Then, after a pause, she added, ‘I
wonder what Aunt Celia really came for.’</p>

<p>‘You think she had some ulterior motive?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t need to think—I <i>know</i> she had,’
cried Maud. ‘I saw it by the look in her
eye—just like a snake. I haven’t lived
eighteen years in Thornton House for nothing,
Phil.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>‘Phil’ rode on in silence, wondering if
there could be any truth in Maud’s surmise;
for he was convinced that Mrs. Belassis was
his enemy, and a more dangerous one than her
husband.</p>

<p>Pondering, however, did not bring him any
nearer the truth; so he gave up puzzling his
head about the matter, and determined to take
this opportunity to speak to Maud about
Lewis Belassis.</p>

<p>‘Maud,’ he began, ‘when is your birthday?’</p>

<p>‘Three weeks next Wednesday,’ answered
the girl promptly.</p>

<p>‘And you will then be twenty-four?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>Maud looked at him, and he looked at her,
and then she broke into a little soft laugh.</p>

<p>‘You dear old Phil, you are so handsome!
I wish I could marry you!’</p>

<p>A curious thrill ran through Tor, and his
eyes were eloquent, but he only answered
coolly enough:</p>

<p>‘But as you cannot—what then, Maud?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ she answered; and her
face took the spoilt-child expression which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
thoughts of Lewis Belassis almost always
brought.</p>

<p>‘You have not made up your mind?’</p>

<p>‘No; I can’t.’</p>

<p>‘But it will be expected of you soon, will
it not?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I suppose so. I know on my birthday
I am to hear the will read, and a letter
papa left with it for me. I believe I shall
be expected to give my answer then, though
the money can’t be divided till a little while
later. Phil, do you think it would be
unfair to Lewis to keep him waiting any
longer?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think you’ll gain anything by
waiting, Maud. I should say the wisest plan
would be to get the matter off your mind,
one way or the other, as soon as you can. I
imagine you’ll feel exactly as you do now, a
year hence, in regard to Lewis. If you
haven’t fallen in love with him all these years,
you are hardly likely to do so now.’</p>

<p>‘I should never be <i>in love</i> with Lewis—never!’
cried Maud, almost disdainfully.
‘Fancy feeling sentimental over a man like
that! But then, I do like him, and I might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
never meet anyone I liked so well; and there
is my money, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t think about the money, Maud,’ said
Tor quickly. He would have liked to promise
there and then, that she should never feel
the need of that—to tell her that he would
make the loss good; but he could hardly
hand over £10,000 of Phil’s money so coolly,
even though he felt sure of his ultimate approval:
and gladly as he would have sacrificed
his own fortune to her, he knew that there was
only one way by which his wealth could be made
hers, and that way was, as yet, closed to him.</p>

<p>‘I can’t help thinking about it,’ answered
Maud. ‘If I had come of age at twenty-one,
as other girls do, I should not have thought as
I do now. Five thousand would have seemed
riches, and love in a cottage the ideal of bliss.
I should have sent Lewis about his business
in double-quick time then, and bought the little
cottage behind Roma’s studio, and lived there
in glorious independence. At twenty-one we
know nothing of life, and are filled to the brim
with romance. But three more years teach
us a good deal;’ and Maud shook her head
gravely. ‘Things take very different proportions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
and we see that life isn’t just what we
pictured. Do you think papa knew that when
he fixed my majority?’</p>

<p>‘No; but I have no doubt Belassis did.’</p>

<p>‘Uncle Belassis!’ cried Maud. ‘What has
he to do with it?’</p>

<p>‘Everything, I imagine. Do you suppose
our father would have made such an iniquitous
will except under compulsion?’</p>

<p>Maud’s face changed visibly.</p>

<p>‘But Uncle Belassis says——’</p>

<p>‘<i>That</i> for what he says.’</p>

<p>Gradually Maud seemed to take in the true
meaning of Tor’s words.</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ she said, and stopped short. ‘Oh! so
that’s how it was! I wonder I did not think
of it before. Phil, you don’t want me to marry
Lewis Belassis?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not; but I wish you to decide for
yourself—to be guided by your own wishes.’</p>

<p>Tor was anxious, if possible, not to interfere
in Maud’s decision. He had a strong hope
that she would of her own accord reject
Lewis.</p>

<p>‘Papa wished it,’ she said, hesitating.</p>

<p>‘Indeed!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>‘You think not? <i>Could</i> Uncle Belassis
have had so much power as all that?’</p>

<p>‘Could your father have cared so much for
a little snuffling brat of five years old, as
Lewis was at the time of the making of that
will?’</p>

<p>Maud considered this aspect of the case with
some gravity.</p>

<p>‘Yes, he certainly would be a “little snuffling
brat” at that age—I can just see him,
though I can’t remember him, as you can. I’ll
tell him some day of your description; it is so
vivid.’</p>

<p>‘Do; and if you want to know whether
the match was approved by other members of
the family, you can ask Aunt Olive what she
thinks.’</p>

<p>‘I know she doesn’t like it.’</p>

<p>‘And I have a letter at home from our
great-uncle, Mr. Maynard, expressing distinct
disapproval, and speaking in no measured
terms of his opinion of Belassis’ share in the
matter.’</p>

<p>Maud began to look amused and interested.</p>

<p>‘Old Uncle Maynard wrote about it, did he?
Oh, you must let me see the letter! I am sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
it will be delightfully funny; he was such a
dear, cross old man, and I was always so cheeky
to him. The Belassis’ were furious because he
took more notice of me than of anybody else,
though that didn’t come to much; but I should
like to see the letter.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll show it you when we go in,’ said Tor,
and then let the talk glide into other channels.
He considered that he had given Maud food for
meditation sufficient for one day, and decided
not to press for an answer, until she had well
thought over the information he had bestowed.</p>

<p>Maud did not forget her curiosity about her
great-uncle’s letter, and as soon as they returned
from their ride she followed Tor into
his study, and begged him to produce it.</p>

<p>‘I know it will be so queer!’ she said, a
smile of anticipation curving her pretty
mouth.</p>

<p>Tor unlocked the drawer, and put in his
hand. He took out Maud’s letter with the
elastic band round it; but no other paper
was with it. He pulled open the drawer to
its utmost limit, and looked again, but the
paper was evidently not there.</p>

<p>‘It’s gone!’ he ejaculated, in some surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>‘Try the next,’ suggested Maud.</p>

<p>‘No good,’ he answered, shaking his head.
‘’Twas only the day I left, that I locked up
the letters about Tor’s business in the opposite
drawer, where I keep everything relating to
him; and I opened this one too, and saw old
Maynard’s letter lying with yours, strapped
together. I could take my oath of it.’</p>

<p>‘Witchcraft!’ said Maud; and then her face
grew grave suddenly, and she added significantly:
‘Witchcraft, or Aunt Celia.’</p>

<p>‘Couldn’t have been Aunt Celia. The
drawer was locked,’ said Tor.</p>

<p>‘Then it must have been a ghost,’ said
Maud seriously. ‘For nobody else could have
opened a locked drawer.’</p>

<p>The two looked at each other in silence.</p>

<p>‘You think her capable of such an act?’</p>

<p>‘She is capable of anything.’</p>

<p>Tor considered, and failed to see any motive
for the robbery.</p>

<p>‘It was a misanthropical letter, anything
but complimentary to the Belassis family;
but I can’t see why she should have purloined
it. It is not a paper they would care to study
long or frequently, I imagine.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>Maud’s face had clouded over.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Celia always knows what she is
about. You may be sure that that paper is
of more value than you know.’</p>

<p>‘If so,’ said Tor composedly, ‘I will take
care to get it back pretty quickly. I am going
over there to-night. In all probability I shall
bring it back with me.’</p>

<p>Maud looked admiringly at him, but shook
her head.</p>

<p>‘You won’t if Aunt Celia wants it; besides,
you cannot ask for it.’</p>

<p>‘I’m not so sure of that,’ said Tor, and
Maud wondered which half of the sentence he
was answering.</p>

<p>After dinner, in the soft summer twilight,
he walked over to Thornton House. Maud
accompanied him through the park, but he
would not let her come farther, nor be present
at his interview with the aunt, about which
she felt very curious.</p>

<p>After she had turned back, he pursued his
way slowly, thinking over what he should
say to her, and also to Belassis, if he should,
as was not improbable, have to encounter
them both. On the whole, he felt he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
rather face the two together than meet them
singly.</p>

<p>In this fortune favoured him. Lewis had
taken his sisters to a dinner-party in the
neighbourhood, and Mr. and Mrs. Belassis
were in earnest talk together in the drawing-room,
when the door was suddenly opened,
and the servant announced in loud tones:</p>

<p>‘Mr. Debenham!’</p>

<p>From the distinct start and shuffle that
followed, Tor was convinced that he had
interrupted a conversation in which his name
occupied a prominent place. In nowise disconcerted,
however, he walked up and shook
hands in his easiest fashion, and then sat down
in such a position as commanded a good view
of both the countenances before him.</p>

<p>‘I hear you walked over to see me yesterday
morning,’ began Tor, addressing Mrs. Belassis.
‘I am sorry you had your trouble for nothing.
I have come over to learn the object of your
visit, and save you the trouble of a second
walk.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, thank you—I am sorry you took the
trouble. I merely came to ask if you could
supply us with butter for a time. I suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
it must be the hot weather, for we cannot
make half enough for ourselves just now.’</p>

<p>‘So that was the important message that
could not be trusted to paper,’ said Tor, with
a smile. ‘Yes, certainly you shall have all
you need. I will speak to the man to-morrow.
I am sorry such a small affair should have
occasioned you so long a walk.’</p>

<p>‘It did not, thanks; I was close to Ladywell
as it happened, and I wanted to see your
aunt.’</p>

<p>Tor knew she had made no attempt to see
Mrs. Lorraine, and his slight questioning smile
said as much; but he made no open comment.
Mrs. Belassis sat stonily composed. If she
had any inward trepidation she gave no outward
sign of it.</p>

<p>Tor turned to the uncle.</p>

<p>‘We are getting almost dried up here in the
south, sir. We look quite parched. In Yorkshire
now, everything is beautifully fresh—though
not so forward as with us.’</p>

<p>‘You have been in Yorkshire, then?’ questioned
Mrs. Belassis, as if she welcomed the
change of subject.</p>

<p>‘Yes, upon some business of Mr. Torwood’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
It’s a fine county, I should say, by what I saw
of it. Do you know it at all, sir?’</p>

<p>‘I—oh—Yorkshire, did you say?’ said
Belassis, seemingly rather flustered by the
sudden query. ‘Why, Yorkshire is a big
place, you know. Yes, to be sure, I was there
once, when I was a lad; but that’s a long time
ago now;’ and he gave rather a sickly laugh.</p>

<p>Tor fancied that his wife noticed his constrained
manner, and glanced curiously at
him.</p>

<p>‘It was a pretty little town I had to visit,
quite an ideal place for quiet picturesqueness.
Whitbury was its name. I suppose you do
not know anything of it?’</p>

<p>Mr. Belassis’ face seemed to turn all colours
at once.</p>

<p>‘Whitbury—Whitbury!’ he stammered, with
an immense effort to make his voice sound
natural. ‘No, I don’t remember that name.
I don’t think I could ever have been there.’</p>

<p>‘I am sure you would never have forgotten
the place if you had seen it,’ continued Tor.
‘It is so particularly pretty. There is a
fine old church there, and a river running
through the valley, which is quite a resort for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
fishermen, I believe. I have some thoughts of
going there again some day to fish. The
Angler’s Arms is an inviting little inn.
There is something very attractive to me in a
simple little English town.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes—very—very much so,’ answered
Belassis vaguely, feeling as though an iron
hand was clutching at his throat, yet experiencing
an insane desire to find out whether or
not this detestable nephew was talking with a
purpose.</p>

<p>The frank affable manner gave him a dim hope
that all was well; but he dared not meet the
eyes which perhaps would have told him more.</p>

<p>‘You—you—went on business for your
friend, did you? How comes he to have business
in Whitbury? I thought he had lived
always abroad.’</p>

<p>‘He has property in Whitbury; a very
charming old house inhabited by a very
charming maiden lady. The house stands in
a square, and faces the Minster, but looks
behind on to a lovely stretch of country. Its
mistress is a particularly clever and pleasant
woman—a Miss Descartes—Miss Marjory
Descartes as she seems to be always called.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Belassis’ face had paled to a dull grey hue.
His wife’s eyes were fixed upon it curiously
and unquietly. Tor continued talking in the
same frank, gossiping way.</p>

<p>‘It was some business about a new lease
that took me down; but Miss Marjory and I
became great friends. She was good enough
to like me, and I was charmed with her.
Perhaps some day I may have the pleasure of
introducing her here. I have great hopes of
inducing her to visit us at Ladywell some
time or other.’</p>

<p>The dull grey hue changed to a delicate
pea-green. Tor felt a sort of compassion
for the miserable man before him. He had
learnt all he wished to know. This man was
none other than Nelly Roberts’s husband, and
he had <i>not</i> made sure of her death before
marrying again. Had he done that, he would
hardly have been so hopelessly cowed. The
discovery of a former marriage, and a low one,
would be an awkward affair enough for him
to face now; but would hardly account for such
a depth of terror as was visible in his face.</p>

<p>As Tor, however, had found out what he
wished, he rose to depart. His quick eyes had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
not been occupied altogether with the faces
before him. He had caught sight of a corner
of thick parchment-like paper projecting from
a drawer in a small table, which was rather
oddly placed in front of Mr. and Mrs. Belassis.
He had heard a crackle of stiff paper as he
entered the room.</p>

<p>By a quick, quiet movement, Tor reached
forward and secured the paper; the drawer, of
course, opened as he pulled, and disclosed to
his view a number of soiled bread-crumbs and
some pieces of india-rubber.</p>

<p>‘Rubbing out, by Jove!’ he thought to
himself, and wondered what could have been
accomplished by that process. Aloud he
said:</p>

<p>‘Ah, my old uncle’s letter! How curious
it should be here! I had just missed it from
its accustomed place. What an old misanthrope
he was! Not, I suppose, that he
had any idea into whose hands it would fall.
How could it have been spirited here?’</p>

<p>‘I brought it, Philip,’ answered Mrs. Belassis
imperturbably. ‘I was just about to return
it to you. I found it by chance in your room
yesterday, as I was looking for some writing-paper.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
Curiosity prompted me to read it, and
I could not refrain from bringing it back for
your uncle to see. He is slow to believe the
ingratitude of the world. I think that such
expressions as are put down here, by a man
who always received from him a respect and
consideration he was far from deserving,
should do much to convince him. I must
apologize for the liberty I took with your
property; but you were absent, and I thought
you would not object.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I have not the least objection in the
world,’ answered Tor readily and pleasantly.
‘I had merely kept the contents of the paper
to myself because they were not over and
above flattering to those mentioned in it.
What puzzles me is how you came to chance
upon the letter, as it was always kept in a
locked drawer.’</p>

<p>‘It was not there yesterday,’ answered Mrs.
Belassis, the glittering look coming back into
her eyes. ‘It was in the top right-hand
drawer, where your writing-paper is stored.’</p>

<p>‘It must have been spirited there, then,’
laughed Tor, ‘for I left it in the left-hand
bottom one, locked up, only the day before.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Well, I will say good-night now. I think we
understand each other; and I will give instructions
about the butter to-morrow.’</p>

<p>It was in rather a peculiarly silent and constrained
fashion that Mr. and Mrs. Belassis
shook hands with their genial nephew and
saw him depart.</p>

<p>Then Belassis wiped his forehead, and sat
down heavily.</p>

<p>‘We only just got that done in time,’ he
said, drawing a long breath, ‘Suppose he
had found it before we had done our work?’</p>

<p>‘He would not have found it at all but for
you,’ answered Mrs. Belassis, with cool contempt.
‘It would have been upstairs, where
it ought to have been, but for your folly.’</p>

<p>‘Mine!’</p>

<p>‘Yes; you would bring it down; and now
this has happened!’</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘He knows that I have been overhauling his
private papers.’</p>

<p>‘He can’t know that.’</p>

<p>‘He does know it. He is not a fool;
besides, he said as much. If you had done as
I counselled, I should have replaced the paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
quietly; and if he had suspected, he could have
said nothing.’</p>

<p>‘You always think you are right, and I am
wrong,’ growled Belassis.</p>

<p>‘Possibly,’ answered the wife; and then,
fixing her eye keenly upon him, she asked:
‘And pray, what is Whitbury? and who is
Miss Marjory Descartes?’</p>

<p>Belassis’ face turned livid; but he answered
with a sudden blaze of anger:</p>

<p>‘How the devil should I know? I never
heard of either one or the other before to-night.’</p>

<p>He flung himself passionately from the
room, and Mrs. Belassis sat quite still in the
twilight.</p>

<p>‘He is trying to keep a secret from me.
What a fool he is!’</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">ere</span>, Maud—here is old Uncle Maynard’s
letter, if you want to read
it!’</p>

<p>So said Tor, as he entered the drawing-room,
after his visit to Thornton House; and
Maud started up with an exclamation of
pleasure at seeing him again so soon. When
she took in the drift of his remark, her eyes
opened wide with surprise.</p>

<p>‘The letter, Phil? Had Aunt Celia got it,
then?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; she had <i>borrowed</i> it to show to her
precious husband. She found it amongst my
writing-paper, she says.’</p>

<p>‘That’s a lie,’ said Maud, with the frankness
of her nature; ‘for I tidied out that drawer
the day you went to Whitbury.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>‘And I left the paper locked up that same
day,’ added Tor, smiling. ‘Aunt Celia must
have a vivid imagination.’</p>

<p>‘Did you tell her she was lying?’ asked
Maud eagerly. ‘I mean, did you say that it
was in the locked drawer?’</p>

<p>‘There was no need to say very much. Mrs.
Belassis is not dense. She quite understood
me. It is better to avoid saying disagreeable
things, when meaning them does as well.’</p>

<p>‘I always want to say them,’ answered
Maud candidly. ‘But isn’t she dreadful?
She must have a duplicate key of your table.
Do you think she has taken anything else?’</p>

<p>‘I shall look and see to-morrow. I don’t
think there is anything in that table that she
would care to possess. What beats me, is the
motive for taking that letter. It is disagreeable
enough, but of no value. Read it, Maud,
and see if you can find out anything which
could explain her deed.’</p>

<p>Maud obeyed. After reading a little way
she became so much amused that she turned
again to the beginning, and read it out aloud,
so that Aunt Olive might have the benefit of
the joke. She enjoyed vastly the old man’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
misanthropic utterances, and her comments as
she read amused the listeners as much as did
the letter itself.</p>

<p>‘Dear, cross old Uncle Maynard!’ she exclaimed.
‘Isn’t it splendid how Uncle Belassis
outwitted himself by keeping you away, Phil?
How savage they must have been when they
saw what he says! Oh, I really am glad Aunt
Celia found it—it does so serve them right!
He must have hated the Belassis family. I
always thought he did. Do you think he’s
really right about the will? Did Uncle
Belassis make papa put that condition in,
Phil? If he did, that settles the matter. I
won’t have anything to do with a plot of
Uncle Belassis’ making. I’ll send Lewis to
the right-about pretty quick, if I’m just to be
made a dupe of that horrid Belassis.’</p>

<p>Maud’s cheek had flushed. Her eyes sparkled
with anger.</p>

<p>‘“Women will marry anything,” will they?
Well, I’ll not marry Lewis to please his father—nothing
shall persuade me. Yes, Phil; uncle
was right. If you had not come back in time I
might have been half bullied, half coaxed into
it—for I do like Lewis, and I hate a row; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
if you’ll back me I don’t care for anything,
and I’ll defy Uncle Belassis to his face!’</p>

<p>Tor smiled and stood beside the girl, who
had risen in her excitement, and was standing
erect and indignant, with the letter held fast in
her hands. He put his hand upon her shoulder
and looked down into her face.</p>

<p>‘All right, little sister. You need have no
fears on that point. You and I are more than
a match for old Belassis; and you shall neither
be bullied nor coaxed into doing anything you
do not like—I will take good care of that.
But leave the open defiance to me; and content
yourself with the calm <i>hauteur</i> of the
<i>grande dame</i>.’</p>

<p>Maud’s face took a different expression, and
the angry light died out of her eyes. She
looked up at him with a grateful admiration.</p>

<p>‘You are just an angel-boy, Phil. I wish
I could be like you; but I’m afraid I shall
never be the <i>grande dame</i>, I’m much too quick-tempered
and volatile; I can’t think how you
can keep so cool. I wish I could. I wish I
were like you.’</p>

<p>‘So do not I—I like you as you are,
Maud,’ answered Tor. ‘But I am not going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
to let you make any important decision as to
your future in a moment of heat. You must
think the matter over dispassionately, and
come calmly to your decision. But you see
what the old fellow says about my duty. You
are not to be a loser by your decision, Maud.
A wish like that from a testator cannot be
lightly set on one side. Remember that,
Maud, when you weigh the matter in the
balances.’</p>

<p>Tor knew quite well that the more Maud
thought of a marriage with Lewis Belassis,
the less she would like it, so he had no misgivings
about inculcating this dispassionate
consideration. He was doing the duty of an
elder brother, without any fear that his own
chances would suffer thereby. To be the dupe
of a Belassis plot and to be the victim of his
scheming would, he knew, be the more intolerable
to her, the longer she looked at the
matter.</p>

<p>But Maud broke in upon his thoughts with
an imperious gesture.</p>

<p>‘Nonsense, Phil! I won’t have you do anything
romantic and ridiculous. This is a big
place, and you will want a lot of money to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
it up. As long as you are not married, I’ll live
here and keep house for you; and when you
marry, I’ll beg, borrow, or steal one of those dear
little cottages at the end of the park, and live
there on the remains of my fortune; and you
shall keep a horse for me here, and ride out
with me once or twice a week; and I’ll stay
there an old maid, until somebody as nice as
you turns up and makes love to me, and then
I’ll marry him. But,’ and here she heaved a
melodramatic sigh, ‘I’m afraid there is nobody
else in the world half as nice as you.’</p>

<p>‘Of course not,’ he answered, smiling. ‘Now
sit down, Maud, and let us be sensible for once.
I do want to find out, if I can, why Mrs. Belassis
cribbed that paper. She must have had a
motive, and a strong one. She would not
have done anything quite so suspicious without.’</p>

<p>‘That’s true,’ assented Maud; and she returned
to a minute examination of the paper.</p>

<p>After turning it round and round several
times, she proceeded to unfold it, and then
her eyes opened wide with a look of comprehension.</p>

<p>‘Look here, Phil! She has been rubbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
something out. There was something written
in pencil on the inside. What was it?’</p>

<p>Tor looked over her shoulder, and saw plain
traces of careful erasure. He pulled at his
moustache, and whistled under his breath.</p>

<p>‘By Jove! So she has!’</p>

<p>‘What was it, Phil?’ asked Maud eagerly.
‘What had old Uncle Maynard written
there?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know, Maud. I had never unfolded
the paper. It never occurred to me
that there was writing on the inside.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Maud slowly. ‘I don’t suppose
it did. Men are never curious, and there isn’t
anything to make anyone turn over. I wonder
what it was. Something important, of course,
or Aunt Celia would not have troubled to run
a risk for it.’</p>

<p>All three faces were grave. Tor felt that
through an unconscious blunder of his, some
distinct damage might have been done to Phil,
though how or why he could not tell. It was
not easy to see what harm could ensue from
neglect of a few pencilled words—added quite
as an afterthought to the letter; but at the
same time, Mrs. Belassis’ conduct had made it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
evident that importance did attach to them;
and Tor was disturbed at this discovery.</p>

<p>It was useless, however, to try to conjecture
what the last message could have been, and
lamentations over the casualty were equally
purposeless. Tor had some dim hope that he
might surprise the truth from one or other of
the Belassis’ at some later date, but at present
silence was their only course.</p>

<p>Maud talked herself sleepy, and went to bed;
Mrs. Lorraine was about to follow her example,
when Tor asked her to remain a little while
longer, as he had something of importance he
wished to say to her.</p>

<p>The gentle little widow looked half surprised
at this announcement, for nobody since her husband’s
death had ever cared to discuss matters
of importance with her; but she assented
readily, and settled herself once more in her
chair.</p>

<p>‘Well, dear boy?’</p>

<p>‘I want to ask you what you know about
Alfred Belassis—of his early life, I mean.
You have always lived in this neighbourhood,
have you not? You know as much of the
family history as anyone.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, I suppose I do; but I do not know
anything of Alfred Belassis’ early life. I
never saw him until a few years before he
married Celia.’</p>

<p>‘Who were the Belassis’?—the seniors, I
mean? Were they not very much below your
family in social position?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I always thought so. I always
wondered how Celia could make such a marriage,
though we ought not to be proud I
suppose; and Alfred Belassis had very good
worldly prospects.’</p>

<p>‘I want you to tell me how it all came
about, so far as you know the story. Begin
with the father. How did the intimacy between
the families begin?’</p>

<p>‘The father was James Belassis. He was a
solicitor in the town of Darwen—where the
coach stops, you know. He was a respectable
kind of man, but not a gentleman. Nobody
knew much about him until father—our father,
I mean—found out that he was a very clever
man of business, and gradually put all his
affairs into his hands. Other people followed
father’s example, and Belassis soon found himself
in very much improved circumstances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
and on the high-road to wealth. He had been
a careful, saving man always, and had made a
fair amount of money before; and I can
remember father saying one day, that he had a
son whom he had educated almost like a gentleman,
and who was, he fancied, rather wild.’</p>

<p>‘When did all this take place?’ asked Phil.</p>

<p>‘I don’t exactly know when father first
employed Belassis. It must have been when
I was quite a girl. But it was, I think, in
1843 that Alfred Belassis first appeared upon
the scene.’</p>

<p>‘What made him come?’</p>

<p>‘His father sent for him. He was getting
on so well that he wanted his son to come and
take a share of the business, and learn enough
to step into his shoes. Alfred had been in the
office when quite young; but his father had
indulged him, and it had ended by his going
off to see the world, that he might be made
into a gentleman.’</p>

<p>‘The world must be congratulated on the
gentleman it has turned out,’ remarked Tor.
‘Well, the young man came back in ’43, did
he?—to a sudden prospect of wealth and
importance; and what then?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>‘I have always thought it was at that time
that James Belassis began to have hopes of
making a good marriage for his son, and I
believe he always had his eye upon one of our
father’s three daughters. We were not bad-looking
girls, Maud, Celia, and I; but men—marriageable
men—were scarce, and it was not
to be wondered at if James Belassis should
make such a plan. His son would be rich,
and he had had a gentleman’s education, and
was not a match to be utterly despised in these
parts; I think our father secretly favoured
him. He wanted his daughters well married,
I know.’</p>

<p>‘Did Alfred Belassis fall in with his father’s
plans for his future?’ asked Tor, in rather a
peculiar tone.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think so. He came here often, and
paid us all a good deal of attention; but for
several years nothing happened. I think it
was four years before he even proposed to Celia.
Maud had married your father by that time,
and I think it was soon afterwards that he asked
Celia; and they were engaged quite a long
time. I used to think he didn’t really want to
marry her—he kept putting it off so much.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Men were generally afraid of Celia; I think
that was why she never had an offer till Alfred
Belassis asked her. I don’t think she ever
cared very much for him; but father was for
it, and she wished to be independent. I used
often to fancy Alfred was half afraid of her.
He was so very long in coming to the
point.’</p>

<p>‘When were they married?’</p>

<p>‘In May, 1850—I remember I did not like
them to be married in May; but Celia said it
was all superstitious nonsense. Alfred would
have waited till June, but Celia said if it
wasn’t in May it should be in April; and then
they settled for May. Celia had got quite out
of patience with his “shilly-shallying.” She
threatened to break off the match, if he never
intended to get married.’</p>

<p>‘Why didn’t he break it off, if he was so
much afraid?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, he never could bear her to talk like
that. He was bent on the marriage, but he
seemed so inclined to keep putting it off. He
acted very oddly altogether. You know Celia
was a good match; for I was cut out of father’s
will when I married, and Maud and Celia had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
my fortune between them. Celia was father’s
favourite, and she got the most in the end.’</p>

<p>Tor sat still, digesting what he had heard.
All pointed conclusively to the theory he had
formed, that Alfred Belassis had not verified the
fact of his first wife’s death, before his marriage
with Celia Maynard. He had evidently been
summoned home suddenly, to hear of an increase
of fortune, and fairly good worldly position,
and the prospect of an excellent marriage; and
he had not had the honesty or courage to
confess that he was already married. A wife
like Nelly Roberts would be a millstone round
his neck all his life, preventing his ever rising
to the standing he might otherwise hope to
attain; and with his usual lack of principle,
and clumsy cunning, he had trusted that
chance would favour him, and that the ex-lady’s-maid
would remain in the seclusion
where he had left her, and never trouble him
more.</p>

<p>At the end of seven years he evidently had
heard nothing of her, and had then, though
obviously with some misgivings, entered a
second time into the bonds of ‘holy matrimony.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>‘Why do you ask all these questions,
Philip?’ asked Mrs. Lorraine. ‘What can it
matter now, how or when all this happened?
I know it was an evil day for all of us when
Belassis entered our family; but why do you
want to know the details?’</p>

<p>‘I will tell you why, Aunt Olive. It is a
disgraceful story enough, and I do not wish it
to go further; but it will be safe with you;
and I think one of the family should know
it.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine looked half surprised, half
alarmed.</p>

<p>‘What is it, dear boy?’</p>

<p>‘Did Belassis ever mention a former marriage
to your sister, or to anyone?’</p>

<p>‘A former marriage? Oh dear no! He
was not married, and never could have been.
He was only about three-and-twenty when he
came here, and he lived here seven years before
he married. Oh no, he could not have been
married before that—it is quite impossible.
What makes you ask such a very odd
question?’</p>

<p>‘Because he was married before—he made
a low sort of marriage, with a pretty lady’s-maid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
only a few months before he appeared at
Ladywell.’</p>

<p>And forthwith Tor launched into the history
of his visit to Whitbury, and the discovery
which had been forced upon him there.</p>

<p>Aunt Olive listened aghast, especially when
it dawned upon her that her brother-in-law
was a much greater rascal than even she had
ever before believed, and that he had shamefully
deceived her sister. Only too well did
she now perceive the cause of his uneasiness
before the wedding; and her dismay at the
possibility, to which they could not blind themselves,
fairly took her breath away.</p>

<p>‘I trust all may be well on <i>that</i> score,’ said
Tor, knowing well what was in her mind.
‘For the girl did die, poor thing, somewhere
about 1850, and we shall try to ascertain the
exact date if it is possible. I do not in the
least believe that this disgraceful episode need
ever be made public; but I think it will give me
the whip-hand of Belassis if ever he is troublesome.
The secret is known only to me and
to Miss Marjory Descartes. I think we are
both to be trusted. I shall do nothing which
might bring down sorrow and disgrace upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
the innocent. If he lets my affairs alone, I
will let his.’</p>

<p>Tor was not long in finding that he had got
the whip-hand of Belassis pretty considerably.
He was riding over the farm the following
day, when the uncle joined him, mounted on
an old screw, which was too broken-down in
spirit to frighten the most timid horseman.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Phil, my boy!’ he cried with great
heartiness. ‘Just the fellow I wanted to see.
Ride on with me a little away from these
clodhoppers—so, not too fast. I just wanted
a word or so with you.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Hum—ah—well—you spoke last evening
of Whitbury, did you not?’</p>

<p>‘I believe I did, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes—well, perhaps you might have
observed a little constraint in my manner, did
you?—a little absence of my usual frank
heartiness—eh?’</p>

<p>‘I certainly did notice something odd. I
fancied it might be a threatening of cholera,’
answered Tor, ‘you went so green.’</p>

<p>‘Ha! ha! Very good—cholera indeed!
What a wag you are, Philip! No, no—now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
let us see—what was I saying? Oh, Whitbury?
yes; and Miss Marjory Descartes. I
suppose my name was not mentioned between
you?’</p>

<p>‘She seemed to know the name Belassis,
when it came up casually in conversation. I
believe she had known a Belassis in past days.
A relation of yours?’</p>

<p>‘Ah well, never mind now. I know you’re
not a chatterer, Philip, and I’m going to make
a father confessor of you. Ha! ha! that’s
rather good, isn’t it? I say, old chap, do you
know what wild oats are?’</p>

<p>He dug Tor playfully in the ribs. The
young man smiled, and answered readily:</p>

<p>‘Well, yes, sir; I have some acquaintance
with the article. They are generally pleasanter
things to sow than to reap.’</p>

<p>‘Why, yes, boy; so you have found that out
too! Ah me! we all run a bit wild in our
youth. I dare say you have played Don Juan
sometimes before now—eh? Well, never
mind that. It isn’t fair to ask too many such
questions. But to come to the point; what I
want to tell you is this—I sowed most of my
wild oats in Whitbury.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>‘Indeed!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I did; and that’s why I didn’t much
care to talk about the place. Now mind you,
boy, I did nothing really wrong—no, no. I
was wild and foolish; but I never disgraced
my father’s name’—here his face assumed an
edifying expression of virtuous complacency.
‘I was only a bit gay and wild; but still one
doesn’t like such episodes brought to light
after a number of years—you will know better
what I mean when you are married, and settled
down in life. My wife, now, is what I call a
fastidious woman—an uncommonly particular,
upright, conscientious woman.’</p>

<p>‘Quite so,’ ejaculated Tor softly.</p>

<p>‘Eh? yes, quite so; I knew you would
agree with me, and you can understand that I
don’t want old Whitbury gossip to come to
her ears. I don’t want to meet Miss Marjory
Descartes, or for her to meet Celia. I’d rather
she never came near the place at all. And I’ll
take it as a personal favour, Philip, if you will
not talk about such things before my wife, or
put ideas into her head, or have Miss Marjory
to Ladywell at all.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>Belassis was flushed, breathless, and incoherent.
Tor answered gravely enough:</p>

<p>‘I can’t promise not to ask Miss Marjory to
Ladywell; but you can keep out of her way
as much as you please. If I were you, I
would tell your wife about these innocuous
wild oats, and get the matter off your mind.
However, I have no wish to introduce the
subject. I always think people had much
better not meddle with their neighbours’ affairs.’</p>

<p>Even Belassis’ thick head caught at the
meaning of these last significant words.</p>

<p>‘Oh, ah—yes,’ he answered uneasily. ‘I
never do interfere—I don’t mean to. We’ll
just keep on good terms, and let one another
alone.’</p>

<p>Belassis rode off as rapidly as he dared,
feeling unequal to prolonging the interview.
Tor, who had seen Maud’s hat over a distant
hedge, put his horse to a gallop, and joined
her by a flying leap.</p>

<p>‘Phil! how you do startle one! What are
you up to now?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve been talking with our respected uncle.
I don’t think he’ll bother us much more. The
open defiance will hardly be needed.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>‘You met Uncle Belassis?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I have just parted from him.’</p>

<p>‘Was he riding?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I can hardly say that. He sat on
his horse, and the horse ran.’</p>

<p>Maud laughed delightedly, and her mind
was diverted from the question of the interview,
as Tor intended it should be.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Phil,’ she said, ‘there came a letter for
you by the mid-day post. It’s from Germany,
and I think perhaps it’s from Tor, or about
him.’</p>

<p>Tor hastened home with all the speed he
could, an eager hope possessing him that he
might see at last Phil’s familiar handwriting.</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">ut</span> no, the letter was not from Phil;
but in the crabbed, minute writing
of the German brain-doctor.</p>

<p>Tor opened the envelope with haste, and
ran his eyes rapidly over its contents, a look
of impatience and dismay crossing his face as
he did so.</p>

<p>The letter was in German, and was somewhat
floridly worded; but its meaning was
only too plain.</p>

<p>Phil was no better—was in fact worse; that
is to say, the prolonged insensibility was
an unfavourable sign. But Dr. Schneeberger
was not despondent. On the contrary, he still
held to his original statement that he believed
time and patience would effect a cure; but he
strongly advocated a different method of treatment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
He was, in fact, very anxious to send
his patient away on a sea voyage, feeling confident
that the change, the sea air and easy
motion of the sailing vessel, would do him
much good. A friend of his was just about
to start on a cruising expedition in the Pacific,
and had volunteered to take charge of ‘Herr
Torwood.’ He was a medical man, a friend
of Dr. Schneeberger, who was going himself
for rest and change, and would be absent only
four months. Four months might do wonders
for the patient, and he was most anxious that
the experiment should be tried. Both doctors
were in its favour, and they only awaited
Mr. Debenham’s consent.</p>

<p>Tor read the letter thoughtfully, and looked
at the case in all its bearings. Just once the
doubt crossed his mind, whether it would not
be better to bring Phil home as he was, tell the
whole story, and let him await his recovery in
his own house, and in his rightful position;
but a little thought decided him against
such a step. Were Phil brought home in
that state, Mr. and Mrs. Belassis, as next
of kin, would have great power; and their
first step would doubtless be to prosecute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
Tor for his ‘felony and forgery.’ Matters
had now gone too far for such a step to be
practicable, and the game had not grown
so desperate yet that Tor felt in any way
obliged to throw it up. Indeed, since his
late discoveries with regard to the rectitude of
both Mr. and Mrs. Belassis, he had felt
strengthened in his position, through the sense
of having his enemies to a certain extent in
his power.</p>

<p>On mature consideration, Tor decided that
it would be best to allow the experiment of the
sea voyage. Should it succeed, as the doctors
seemed convinced that it would, all would
be well; and if not, no risk was run, so far as
he could see, and matters would be in no worse
state than they were now. Meantime, it
might be rather a relief than otherwise to feel
that Phil was safely away at sea, because Mrs.
Belassis was certainly suspicious of something—of
what, Tor did not know; and if by
chance her prying eyes discovered Dr. Schneeberger’s
address, and she took a fancy to visit
him and see his patient, there was no knowing
what unpleasant results might not ensue.</p>

<p>This idea had struck Tor when he realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
how his locks had been tampered with, and it
was not a welcome thought. Mrs. Belassis
was anything but a stupid woman; and once
let her get a clue into her hands, she would
pursue it relentlessly and sagaciously to the
bitter end. Therefore, it might be no bad
move to get Phil quickly and quietly out of
her reach.</p>

<p>Tor therefore wrote his consent, but determined
to see Phil and the doctor before the
plan was put into execution; and, to Maud’s
despair, announced that he was going to start
for Germany at once.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Phil!’</p>

<p>‘Well, Maud, I thought you were so anxious
for me to go and see Tor.’</p>

<p>‘Are you going to see him? Are you
going to bring him here?’</p>

<p>‘The doctor recommends a sea voyage—you
can see what he says if you can read his
German hieroglyphics. I must go over and
see about it.’</p>

<p>Maud tried to decipher the letter, but ended
by bringing it across for Tor to translate. She
looked half-pleased, half-disappointed to hear
of the plan. Tor left out the piece where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
‘prolonged insensibility’ was mentioned. He
did not wish the nature of his friend’s malady
to be generally known. The reason for his
reticence on this point was simply this. If
Mrs. Belassis got hold of the right idea as
regards Phil and his friend, and knew that one
man was in a state of helpless torpor, it would
at once be plain how easily a clever deception
might be practised by the other. But if both
were in possession of their senses, it was
evident that what was done must be by mutual
agreement; and so long as this was the case,
nobody but the man concerned had any right
to interfere with the part his friend was
playing.</p>

<p>‘I wish he had suggested sending him to
England instead. I believe English doctors
could cure him.’</p>

<p>‘Well, if this little fellow fails, we will
employ the faculty here; but I’m inclined to
try this sea voyage first. The doctors speak
with confidence, and one does not like to
thwart them on such a point.’</p>

<p>‘But why does he write to ask you? Can’t
Mr. Torwood decide for himself?’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid by this that he’s not so well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
again, and that he has referred them to me to
judge for him. He always threw the management
and responsibility of things upon me at
the best of times. He is sure to do so more
than ever now. I must certainly go over and
see about it.’</p>

<p>So Tor went, and Maud was left alone; and
in the afternoon, when she had seen him off
upon the coach, she drove to the Merediths,
and dismissed the carriage, so that she might
spend some time with the blind man and his
daughter.</p>

<p>Tor had been a little less frequent in his
visits since the strange proposition on behalf
of his daughter which Mr. Meredith had
made to him about ten days before; and his
journey to Yorkshire and this sudden call to
Germany explained his absence most satisfactorily.</p>

<p>‘Alone, Maud?’ said Mr. Meredith, as he
heard the girl’s step in the room. ‘I thought
you would have surely brought Philip with
you to-day.’</p>

<p>‘I have just taken Phil to the coach. He
sent me to explain matters to you. Phil has
to go to Germany to see his friend, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
is ill. I’m afraid he will be gone a whole
week.’</p>

<p>‘Gone away again!’ echoed Mr. Meredith,
in a tone of disappointment. ‘Why, we have
not seen anything of him for five whole
days!’</p>

<p>‘He has been in Yorkshire, you know, on
his friend’s business, and only came back the
night before last. Then, to-day came another
letter, which sent him tearing off again. I’m
afraid his friend is a sad plague to him just
now—though, of course, he owes ever so much
to him.’</p>

<p>‘A good friend—a good brother,’ said
Michael Meredith, with his slow satisfied smile.
‘Such a man will make a good husband, too—eh,
Maud?’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean Phil, Uncle Michael? Oh
yes; I should think he would make the best
husband in the world. He is so good and
kind and considerate to everyone. But I
don’t much fancy he means to get married—not
yet, at any rate.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, Maud, sisters are not always their
brothers’ confidantes on such subjects.’</p>

<p>Maud looked rather nettled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>‘I’m sure Phil would tell me directly; he
tells me everything about himself.’</p>

<p>‘He is a wonderful brother, then,’ said
Meredith; but his own face had clouded over
somewhat, and by-and-by he asked, with a
touch of sharpness in his tone:</p>

<p>‘Has he never spoken to you, then, of his
engagement?’</p>

<p>‘His engagement?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; are you so much astonished? Did
you not know that he was half-engaged?’</p>

<p>Maud calmed down a little after her first
amazement. She knew that the blind man
was given to romancing, but she could not
yet understand the bearing of such a remark
as this.</p>

<p>‘No, Mr. Meredith. I don’t know anything
about it. To whom is he half-engaged?’</p>

<p>‘To Roma.’</p>

<p>This was said with an air of such pride and
satisfaction that Maud nearly smiled. She
wondered if it could be true. Phil had been
to see the blind man and his daughter a great
deal, and had of late seemed more interested
in Roma; but certainly Maud had seen no
traces of anything like a romantic attachment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>‘Phil engaged to Roma!’ she repeated.
‘He never said a word to me!’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ returned Meredith slowly, half-ready
to retract what he had said, now that he
had produced the desired effect, ‘perhaps I
should hardly say “engaged,” because there has
been no pledge asked or given on either side,
as yet. I do not wish the quiet current of
Roma’s young life disturbed, and your brother
can afford to wait. But words have passed
between him and me; I have read his inmost
heart, and have found it loyal and true—as his
father’s was before him; and now we understand
one another, and he is prepared to abide
by my wishes as to the time of probation.’</p>

<p>For by this time Michael Meredith had fully
persuaded himself that the delay was of his
own making, that the young man was eager
and willing to come forward to claim Roma’s
hand, but that he withheld him, in order that
his daughter’s young heart should not be too
early or too roughly awakened from its sleep
of happy childhood. This Meredith fully
believed, and Maud half-believed it too.</p>

<p>It was a good thing for Tor that Mr. Meredith
had so deceived himself, as it had saved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
him from any further allusions to a subject
not at all agreeable to him. Maud pondered
awhile over these words, and finally said:</p>

<p>‘Is Roma so very young? I always
thought her so wise for her age.’</p>

<p>‘Roma is twenty-five. She may be wise in
some things, I do not deny it; in others, she
is innocent as a child.’</p>

<p>‘Is she?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly. Have you not observed it for
yourself?’ asked Meredith.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. I have never thought
Roma at all childish.’</p>

<p>‘She is a child in all matters that refer to
the heart,’ said Michael Meredith, in his
sententious way. ‘A child to love.’</p>

<p>‘Well, but is it not time——’ began Maud.</p>

<p>‘Not yet—not yet,’ answered Meredith,
anticipating her. ‘I hold her sleeping heart
in my hand; when I bid, it shall awaken.’</p>

<p>Maud considered this great nonsense. That
a girl of Roma’s age should be treated so like
a child or a baby was manifestly absurd, and
she thought that Mr. Meredith was very
foolish and very wrong. If Phil wanted
Roma, he ought to be allowed to propose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
sensibly, as other men did; and be accepted or
refused, as they were. What was the use of
waiting? Roma was surely old enough to
know her own mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith was acute enough to read dissatisfaction
in her silence, and a few questions
brought out the cause. Without the least
intention of doing any mischief, she infused
her own feelings into Mr. Meredith’s mind,
and he began to wonder what was the use of
this delay, and to grow fretful and impatient.</p>

<p>Maud soothed him down, as she knew well
how to do; but Michael Meredith was not
easily satisfied that day.</p>

<p>‘You must go and talk to Roma,’ he said.
‘You said she would know her own mind by
this time, and would accept or refuse Philip.
She shall not refuse him—I will not have it.
Go and find out what she feels, and tell her I
will not have her do anything foolish. When
he asks her, she is to marry him; I have made
up my mind, and she must not disappoint me.’</p>

<p>Maud went to seek Roma in her studio.
She had no fear that any sane person would
reject her idolized Phil; and on the whole, she
was not sorry that he had turned his thoughts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
in her direction. For Maud was sincerely fond
of Roma.</p>

<p>She had constituted herself a kind of ‘guide,
philosopher and friend’ to this lonely girl
who led so secluded a life, and so seldom
mingled in any kind of society. Maud’s
experiences were not very wide, nor her philosophy
very deep; still she had a certain share
of shrewd worldly wisdom, and a warm, affectionate
nature; and Roma had fallen into the
way of giving and receiving confidences when
Maud came to see her, which would have been
impossible to her with any other companion.</p>

<p>‘Now, Roma,’ began Maud, when preliminary
matters had been disposed of, ‘I
have come to say something, and of course I
shall go straight to the point at once. Is
Phil in love with you?’</p>

<p>‘No, certainly not.’</p>

<p>‘Are you sure?’ asked Maud archly.</p>

<p>‘Perfectly sure,’ answered Roma quietly.</p>

<p>Maud looked rather blank. Something in
Roma’s manner carried conviction with it.</p>

<p>‘I suppose father has been talking to you,’
she said. ‘I wish he would not. It is one of
his fancies, Maud, that your brother is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
marry me; but he never will. He does not
care for me, nor I for him—in that way.’</p>

<p>‘But your father said he had spoken about
it—Phil, I mean.’</p>

<p>A look of pain crossed Roma’s face.</p>

<p>‘That means, I suppose, that father has
spoken to Mr. Debenham—I wish he would
not. Your brother is kind, and humours him
because agitation is so bad for him. Please
do not talk to me any more about it. It is a
horrid state of affairs. But you may be quite
sure that your brother and I will never marry.’</p>

<p>‘Would you refuse him if he asked you?’</p>

<p>‘He never will ask me.’</p>

<p>‘But suppose he did,’ urged Maud. ‘You
know he might, Roma; he likes you very
much.’</p>

<p>The girl clasped her hands tightly together,
with a look of keen pain upon her face.</p>

<p>‘I suppose then, I should have to say yes, for
my father’s sake. I cannot—<i>cannot</i> go against
him—not even to save my own life. Some
day, Maud, I will try and tell you why. Oh!
I hope and trust it may not be, for I must do
my father’s bidding.’</p>

<p>Maud was able to give Mr. Meredith the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
required assurance, and to leave him in a state
of placid tranquillity; but she left the house
in a dissatisfied frame of mind, and wished
that she had never been there. She could not
believe that Phil would be so weak as to let
Mr. Meredith cajole him into a marriage that
he was not anxious to make; and it was very
hard upon him to have to humour the old man
because it was bad for him to be vexed.
Altogether Maud felt annoyed and disturbed—vexed
with herself for what she had said to
Mr. Meredith, with him for being so foolish
and irrational, and with Roma for talking
and looking as though marriage with Phil
would be the most dreadful thing in the
world.</p>

<p>She thought things had come to an odd
sort of pass, and determined that she would
not go to the house again until Phil had come
back, and could tell her the true state of the
case. For in spite of all that Mr. Meredith
had implied, she knew her brother would be
frank with her.</p>

<hr class="tb" >

<p>Meantime Tor was travelling rapidly towards
Freyburg, at which place he arrived one evening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
about twelve hours later than his letter
had done.</p>

<p>From the hotel he walked straight up to
Dr. Schneeberger’s house, and was met by the
lively little Gretchen, who welcomed him with
volubility and warmth, and was genuinely
delighted to see him.</p>

<p>But she shook her head in mournful fashion
over the helpless state of his poor friend, and
lamented its sadness. Such a fine handsome
young man—everyone said that who
saw the Herr Torwood. Ah, it was what
nobody could understand, that he should be
struck down like that.</p>

<p>Tor asked for the doctor, who quickly
appeared, looking just as dried up as ever,
but somewhat more anxious and constrained
in manner, from which Tor feared he had
formed an unfavourable opinion of his friend’s
case. But he spoke more hopefully than
before, and seemed to have great confidence in
the sea voyage. He had taken other opinions,
and all had agreed that the experiment should
be tried. Once or twice he had fancied he
detected some faint return of mental power,
but it had never lasted. Still there seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
some probability that the change of air, the
movement and the stir, might awaken the
dormant faculties.</p>

<p>The little doctor talked rapidly and energetically,
and Tor quietly acquiesced in all he
said. Then he asked to see his friend, and was
taken up to the little clean, bare room that he
so well remembered, and which he could fancy
he had only quitted yesterday.</p>

<p>Phil lay upon the bed, just as he had
done before, his eyes closed, his breath coming
somewhat heavily through the parted lips.
His hair and beard had grown, and were wild
and tangled. Tor was almost glad that the
sheet half-concealed the lower part of the face.
The brow and eyes and upper part belonged
to the familiar face of his chosen friend and
companion. Those were Phil’s well-known,
well-cut features. He did not care to look
below, where the changes induced by illness
had given an air of neglect to the once carefully
trimmed moustache and smooth-shaven
cheeks.</p>

<p>He looked down upon the unconscious face
before him with an honest, manly compassion.</p>

<p>‘Poor old fellow! Poor old—Tor!’ he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
muttered (the little doctor stood opposite
looking at him, so he must not trip, even in
English).</p>

<p>‘Well, mein Herr,’ said the doctor, ‘what
think you of your friend?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what to think. He looks
just the same to me. I suppose it’s no good
my speaking to him? He wouldn’t hear?’</p>

<p>‘You can try,’ answered Dr. Schneeberger
with a dim interest in his tone.</p>

<p>‘If only he would go!’ thought Tor, but he
could not suggest this, and it sounded a
mockery to address the unconscious Phil by a
false name. Still, he bent over him, and called
rather loudly:</p>

<p>‘Tor! Torwood! wake up, old fellow!
Don’t you know me—Phil Debenham? Tor,
I say!’</p>

<p>Perhaps there was the faintest motion of the
eyelashes—neither Tor nor the doctor could
be certain; but the eyes remained fast closed,
and no other words evoked the slightest sign
of life.</p>

<p>Tor gave one last long look, and turned
away with a sigh. He almost wished he had
never come. It was so melancholy to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
friend lie there helpless and vacant, whose
help he needed so much.</p>

<p>That evening was spent in consultation with
the doctor, and on the morrow Tor left for
England again. He would gladly have been
Phil’s travelling companion upon this voyage,
but affairs at Ladywell would not permit of
his prolonged absence. So he had to leave
Phil in the care of the kindly Germans, who
gave him many hopeful assurances, that when
next he saw his friend he would be restored
to health and strength.</p>

<p>Tor sincerely hoped that they would prove
right.</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">hen</span> Belassis heard that his troublesome
nephew had gone to Germany,
and would probably be absent for
a week, he seemed to breathe more freely
again; for since the evening on which he had
heard of the sudden visit to Whitbury, he had
felt like one who lives with a drawn sword
suspended over his head. Not even his conversation
in the field on the following day had
restored his shaken equanimity, for he was
not at all assured that his statement had been
believed, although it had not been contradicted.
Belassis and his wife had both ample food for
meditation, and were glad of the respite which
this visit to Germany had afforded.</p>

<p>‘Now is our time, if ever, to search for the
will,’ said Mrs. Belassis, the same evening that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
Lewis had told them of the sudden journey.
‘Why did we not have this clue before, when
Ladywell stood empty? We could have done
anything then. Now it may be difficult, and
even dangerous.’</p>

<p>Belassis shook his head helplessly, and did
not know what to suggest.</p>

<p>‘You never do,’ returned his wife coolly.
‘I can’t think what has come to you, Alfred;
you used to have plenty of assurance, and
meddled with matters you had much better
have let alone, and now that a real emergency
has come, you are no better than a girl. I’d
be ashamed to be such a poor creature.’</p>

<p>Belassis did not resent this language, for he
felt himself a poor creature enough at that
moment. What his wife said of him was only
too true. Some change had come over him
for which he could not account, and his old
cunning and craft seemed to have entirely
deserted him.</p>

<p>As a fact, it was circumstances that had
changed, not his nature. Belassis was a man
who could go on swimmingly whilst things
were prosperous, whilst the game was in his
own hands, and success within his grasp, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
he could not stand up against misfortune; and
when the tide of his luck seemed turning, he
could only look on dismayed, feeling hopelessly
unequal to the task of stemming the torrent.</p>

<p>His father had been a clever man, and had
put his son in the way of becoming wealthy
and respected. He left him a handsome
property and a flourishing business, and had
secured for him a well-dowered wife. Alfred
Belassis therefore had made an excellent start
in life, for he was trusted and respected for
his father’s sake, and admitted into society for
his wife’s.</p>

<p>So long as he had only had to deal with
men like Philip Debenham senior, all had gone
well. He had fleeced him with impunity,
speculated with his money, and had contrived
that all gain should be his own, and all loss
his client’s. He had even gone so far as to
speculate with Maud’s trust-money, and the
speculation had been a lamentable failure.</p>

<p>Belassis’ own fortune, too, had suffered
through his folly and ill luck; and since this
new relative had turned up, with his cool
inquiring words and amused incredulous looks,
the ground seemed actually slipping away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
from under his feet, and he could only lean
upon his wife for support. The idea that she
might now learn the treacherous part he had
played towards her, was an added terror; and
Belassis sometimes felt disposed to make a
bolt for it, and get away altogether from his
present surroundings, but his natural weakness
and irresolution deterred him.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid I am but a poor creature, my
dear,’ he answered, with a sickly smile. ‘I
think I cannot be very well just now.’</p>

<p>‘Pooh, nonsense! You’re well enough,
only cowardly. Now look here. I’m nearly
sure that Philip Debenham has never seen
those words about the later will. For one
thing, I don’t believe the paper had ever been
unfolded before I opened it out; and for
another, if Philip had known of it, the search
would have been instituted at once; and if the
will had been in existence at all, it would have
been found. I’ve never heard that any search
has been made; and besides, although Philip
did ask you something about a later will, it
seemed to be pure guess-work, for he imagined
that it had fallen into your hands.’</p>

<p>‘I wish to heaven it had!’ groaned Belassis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
‘If there is another will, and if it is found, we
shall be ruined.’</p>

<p>‘Just so; and as we both believe that
another will was made, we must take care that
it falls into no hands but our own.’</p>

<p>Belassis groaned again.</p>

<p>‘You really think he made another?’</p>

<p>‘You know I always did think he intended
making another, when you told me how
perfectly ready he was to agree to your suggestion,
and to make that condition, and write
that letter. You had plenty of bluster in
those days, Alfred, and Philip feared you; and
you could always get the whip-hand of him
by threatening to throw up his business
affairs, which he was fool enough to think
were prospering in your hands. He dared
not oppose you; but I never trusted him,
when I knew how easily he had granted that
monstrous condition, and that without any
love for us or for Lewis. If he had argued
and disputed and then given way, I might
have believed better in it; as it was, I never
had much faith.’</p>

<p>‘Nor I very much; but I never could find
out anything suspicious, and I watched him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
as a cat does a mouse. Nothing in his papers
was found to upset the will in my possession.’</p>

<p>‘Well, there can be no doubt now that the
will was made; the only question is, was it
accidentally or purposely destroyed? or is it
still in the library at Ladywell, hidden away?
As Philip Debenham had the acuteness to put
it somewhere out of your reach, it is hardly
likely he would ever be weak enough to make
away with it himself. I believe it is still
there.’</p>

<p>Belassis wiped his forehead with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>‘Old Maynard could not find it.’</p>

<p>‘Old Maynard would not look with the
energy that we shall. If it is there, find it we
<i>must</i>.’</p>

<p>‘How?’ asked Belassis vaguely.</p>

<p>‘That remains to be proved. After what
has gone before, it may be difficult; but I will
make an attempt whilst Philip is away; if
that fails, we must consider further.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis did make the attempt without
further loss of time. That same afternoon she
went over to Ladywell, in order to consult
some books of reference in the library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>She had done the same thing sometimes in
the former owner’s time, as a means of gaining
occasional access to her gruff old uncle.
In this lay her chief hope, that her visit
might pass unremarked, and that she might
be allowed to prosecute her search unsuspected.</p>

<p>The library at Ladywell was of great size,
and contained a really large collection of books.
If the will was concealed in one of these, it
might be a weary while before it saw the light.
Still Mrs. Belassis was not daunted by that
thought. If it was there, she would find it,
if only opportunity were granted her. The
strong probability that, even if in existence, it
might lie undiscovered for generations, was but
a poor consolation to Mrs. Belassis. So long
as she believed it to be there, she could enjoy
no rest. Any day some chance might reveal
its hiding-place, and then ruin stared them in
the face. It must be found by herself or her
husband, and destroyed as soon as found, and
then perhaps they would know peace again.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Belassis went openly to Ladywell,
and was shown by her own request into the
library. Miss Debenham and Mrs. Lorraine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
she was told, were to start in ten minutes’
time for a garden-party.</p>

<p>This was good news. Mrs. Belassis took
down a few books, and sat down to study
them, to give colour to her story in case either
lady should come in. It was not many
minutes before Maud entered. Her cheeks
were flushed, and her eyes sparkled a little as
she addressed Mrs. Belassis.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Aunt Celia, I heard you were here.
I am afraid you will be disappointed if you
stay. I don’t think Phil keeps any of his
private papers in the library. Would you not
like to go up to his bedroom? I do not know,
of course, as I am not specially interested in
his correspondence; but I dare say you would
find there a good deal you might like to see.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis looked coldly contemptuous.
Inwardly she was raging.</p>

<p>‘Such a remark hardly deserves an answer,
Maud.’</p>

<p>‘What a good thing, for I am afraid you
would not find it very easy to make one,’
retorted Maud quickly. ‘Well, I must go
now. I hope you will find the books interesting,
but I am afraid you will be disappointed.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>Maud swept away, and Mrs. Belassis heaved
a sigh of relief. She believed that she would
not now be further molested; and when she
heard the carriage roll away, a smile of
triumph crossed her face. The triumph was
short-lived. The door opened softly and
admitted Mrs. Lorraine.</p>

<p>‘Good-afternoon, Celia. I have brought
my work in here this afternoon. It is the
coolest room in the house, I think.’</p>

<p>She sat down beside the window, and drew
out her work, talking quietly and gently the
while.</p>

<p>‘I thought you were going to a party with
Maud,’ said Mrs. Belassis sharply.</p>

<p>‘I have changed my mind. It is too hot to
enjoy such things.’</p>

<p>‘You have never let Maud go alone! She
is not to be trusted by herself anywhere.’</p>

<p>‘I have the greatest confidence in dear
Maud. But she will not go alone. We were
to call for Mrs. Nelson. Maud will go now
under her care.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis turned over her books with
the haste of deeply-seated annoyance. Then
she turned irritably upon the gentle sister,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
whom she had been accustomed for so many
years to tyrannize over successfully.</p>

<p>‘Well, I wish you would go away now,
Olive. I can’t bear company when I want to
study.’</p>

<p>‘I will not disturb you,’ answered Mrs.
Lorraine, settling herself quietly back in her
chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis looked rather as she might
have done had a dove turned upon her.</p>

<p>‘You decline to leave me, do you, Olive?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Celia, I do. You are our guest
whilst you are in this house—Maud’s and
mine. It is not usual to leave guests alone.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Lorraine spoke timidly yet firmly.
She had not lived two months under Tor’s
protection for nothing. She was not ashamed
or afraid to assume that position which he had
always accorded to her. But Mrs. Belassis’
wrath knew no bounds, and to Olive she
allowed it to burst out.</p>

<p>‘In point of fact, you have remained behind
in order to spy upon my doings?’</p>

<p>‘And whose fault is it if I have?’ asked
Mrs. Lorraine, not without dignity. ‘What
should we have seen had anyone spied upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
you whilst you were shut up in Philip’s room
the other day? It is you who force us to
watch you, Celia. Philip is away, and we are
responsible for what goes on in his absence.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis sneered.</p>

<p>‘And so I cannot be allowed to make a few
notes from these books without supervision?
Even old Uncle Maynard, the misanthrope,
was less cautious than you seem to be. Are
you afraid that I shall walk off with some rare
book? I cannot think what has come over
you, Olive.’</p>

<p>‘I could say the same of you, Celia. Why
should you object to my presence here,
unless——’</p>

<p>But Mrs. Belassis rose with dignity.</p>

<p>‘I shall not remain here to be insulted.
Some day, Olive Lorraine, you shall be made
to rue the day when you played the spy upon
me, and made me Philip Debenham’s declared
enemy.’</p>

<p>‘I think enmity is better declared than
secret, Celia,’ answered Mrs. Lorraine tranquilly.
‘You have always been Philip’s
enemy, and you know it.’</p>

<p>‘And now you shall learn what my enmity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
is like, and how it can affect your idolized
nephew. Tell him to look to himself!’</p>

<p>And Mrs. Belassis, with a vindictive scowl
at her daring sister, turned and quitted the
room and the house, feeling for once that she
was foiled.</p>

<p>Lewis had gone to the garden-party whither
Maud was bound; and he had gone thither
with the fixed intention of having some serious
conversation with her. This intention was
partly the result of his own impatience, and
his desire to come to some more definite understanding
with his pretty cousin, and partly on
account of a conversation he had had with his
father upon the previous evening, in which
Belassis had urged upon him with much force
and feeling, the absolute necessity there was
for him to marry Maud; and had begged that
he would not lose the opportunity afforded
by the brother’s absence. He felt certain that
Maud would be more easily influenced in
Philip’s absence than if he were upon the spot;
and he implored his son with feverish energy
to lose no time, and to risk everything rather
than let his cousin throw him over.</p>

<p>His father’s excited manner left an uneasy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
impression upon Lewis’s mind. He could not
see why it should be a life-and-death matter
to anyone but himself, and yet there was no
mistaking the eagerness of the elder Belassis.
Lewis knew enough of his father to make him
distrustful of such earnestness.</p>

<p>At the same time he was willing enough to
talk to Maud, for he feared now that she was
slipping from him, and he was determined
not to yield her up without a struggle.</p>

<p>Poor Lewis! He felt sometimes as though
he had deserved a better parentage and better
prospects. He had been brought up in gentlemanly
idleness, to satisfy his father’s idea of
grandeur and his mother’s family pride, and
was always considered a very lucky fellow,
who would marry an heiress, or at least inherit
her fortune, and succeed at length to the
broad acres attached to Thornton House. But
of late an uncomfortable idea had suggested
itself to Lewis, that things were not quite so
satisfactory as he had believed. His father’s
manner often perplexed him. His mother
looked gloomy and disturbed, and he could
not but fancy that some danger, unknown to
him, threatened them at this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>So it was in a rather dejected frame of mind
that Lewis met Maud that afternoon, and
dejection is not the most favourable of moods
in which to commence a love-passage.</p>

<p>Maud was looking unusually bright and
animated, and was always the centre of an
admiring circle. It was some time before
Lewis could gain possession of her, even for a
few minutes, and not until quite the close of
the afternoon that he succeeded in leading her
away to a more secluded spot, beyond the
reach of curious eyes or sharp ears.</p>

<p>‘Why, Lewis, where are you taking me to?’
asked Maud, pausing at length and looking
back. ‘See what a long way we have
wandered!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and see how nice and cool it is here!’
returned Lewis. ‘I’m sure you like it better
than all that heat and glare. There’s such a
pretty little grotto down here by the water.
You’d better come and see it, now you are so
near.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, I’ll come. It’s a pretty sort of
place. It’s been a nice party, hasn’t it,
Lewis?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>‘I hate tennis-parties!’ answered he, with
needless emphasis.</p>

<p>‘Then why did you come?’</p>

<p>‘I came to see you.’</p>

<p>‘To see me!’ Maud looked at him and
laughed. ‘That’s good! As if you didn’t
see me nearly every day of your life!’</p>

<p>‘I never seem to see you alone now for
a moment,’ returned Lewis discontentedly.
‘You always have a crowd of people round
you, or that everlasting Philip. I never can
get in a word edgeways!’</p>

<p>Maud looked at him, and patted his arm
gently with her delicately gloved hand.</p>

<p>‘Now don’t be silly and tiresome, Lewis.
You know you haven’t any real grievance.
Is this the grotto? It is very pretty. Shall
we sit down here a little while? Now you
can talk to your heart’s content.’</p>

<p>They did sit down, but at the same time
Lewis did not seem to have very much to say.
He looked at Maud, and looked at the trickling
water, and held his peace. He had got the
chance he wanted, but he did not seem to
know how to use it.</p>

<p>Maud, too, was silent—and if not embarrassed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
at any rate less ready than usual
to chatter to him. She sat with a look of
gravity stamped upon her face, which deepened
as moments went by.</p>

<p>‘Well, Maud,’ said Lewis, looking up at
length, ‘I suppose we are both of us thinking
about the same subject.’</p>

<p>‘I dare say we are,’ answered the girl
slowly. ‘I suppose it is time we came to
some understanding, Lewis.’</p>

<p>It was not a very promising opening, and
Lewis was aware of it.</p>

<p>‘Well, Maud,’ he said with a sigh, ‘you
know I have loved you all these years, and
wanted to make you my wife. The question
is, will you have me?’</p>

<p>Had Maud’s feelings been in any way likely
to warm towards him, such a beginning would
have been fatal; but as it was, it did not
affect the point at issue, because her mind was
already made up.</p>

<p>‘No, Lewis; I’m afraid I can’t, after all,’ she
said slowly. ‘I do like you, and we’ve been
very good friends always, and I’ve tried to
make up my mind to it. I’ve looked at the
matter every way, and considered everything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
and I’m sure it would be best for us not to
marry.’</p>

<p>Lewis sat looking gloomily at his boots.</p>

<p>‘Aren’t you fond of me, Maud, after the
way we have held together all these years?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Lewis, I am fond of you, and you are
fond of me; but I don’t love you, and what’s
more, you don’t love me—not in the way you
think you do. I am sure we should not be
really happy together, so you had better take
the money, and leave me alone.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t want the money—I want you. It’s
a beastly shame the money ever was left like
that.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, so it is,’ assented Maud readily; ‘but
I can almost be glad that you will have it,
Lewis, for you will find it very convenient.
And—and I hope you won’t go right away, or
do anything rash; because I’m very fond of
you, Lewis, though I can’t marry you.’</p>

<p>Maud spoke with sudden affection, and
Lewis took the little hand she held out and
kissed it.</p>

<p>‘Why can’t you marry me, Maud? Once
you thought you could. Do you care for any
other fellow?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>‘No, no, Lewis; indeed it isn’t that.’</p>

<p>‘Then what is it?’</p>

<p>‘It is partly because I don’t really care
enough for you, Lewis; and I don’t think you
would like to find that out after we were
married; and partly—partly because I do so
detest Uncle Belassis and Aunt Celia. I could
not—oh, I <i>could</i> not take their name, and
make myself more of a relation than I am.’</p>

<p>‘Rather hard on me,’ remarked Lewis.</p>

<p>‘Very hard on you,’ assented Maud, with
emphasis. ‘I know it is, Lewis, and I feel
almost mean to serve you so. Perhaps if I
were in love with you, I could put up with
even that; but I’m not, and I really can’t do
it, more especially as I believe that clause in the
will was all your father’s doing—just a plot to
keep the money in his own family. I think
it’s very hard on you to have such a father.’</p>

<p>Lewis shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid sometimes he’ll get into trouble
one of these days. I believe he’s been speculating
awfully, and that plays old Harry with
the money. I dare say I shan’t be much of a
catch after all, Maud. Perhaps you’re wise to
chuck me over.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>‘Now don’t be disagreeable, Lewis,’ said
Maud. ‘You know if I wanted money, I should
get it by marrying you. I’m glad you will have
something substantial, even if Uncle Belassis
does come to grief. I have thought him looking
very anxious and frightened of late. Do
you think anything has happened?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. I fancy he has something
on his mind, and the mater too. They will
be in an awful way when I tell them your
decision. I suppose you can’t change it,
Maud?’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid not, Lewis; I would if I could.
But don’t you tell them my decision. I will
do that myself on my birthday. I will not
give my final answer yet; I reserve to myself
the right of changing my mind. Don’t build
on hope, but don’t tell them anything. I should
like to tell them myself.’</p>

<p>Lewis accepted this suggestion with some
relief. He was cast down in spirit, and had
no wish to face a blustering or craven father.
He had taken his rejection more quietly than
he had planned, because he saw at once from
Maud’s manner that his case was hopeless.
For some reasons he felt this final decision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
almost a relief. Maud had not been far wrong
in saying that his love was not of quite the
right kind; and he was conscious that his
position as Maud’s husband would be anything
but a pleasant one, did his father prove—as he
almost feared he would prove—to have committed
follies, and even worse, which would
bring his name into unenviable notoriety. Lewis
had begun to have strong suspicions as to his
father’s integrity, and these painful doubts had
been doubly painful when he had thought of
Maud. He loved her well enough to wish to
spare her all needless pain—well enough to be
almost disinterested. But this is hardly the
feeling of the ardent lover, and Maud was not
wrong in saying to herself that night, that the
interview was well over, and Lewis’s heart was
not broken.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">rs. Belassis</span> had been discomfited
by her sister and her niece—by
the two beings she had been
accustomed to snub and trample upon at will—and
her defeat at their hands was as bitter a pill
as she had ever been called upon to swallow.</p>

<p>Moreover, she was conscious of having
brought her defeat upon herself by acting with
less than her ordinary caution. What had
occurred at Ladywell only a few days back,
ought to have been enough to deter her from
a second attempt at search. She had known
this all along, but her intense eagerness to
gain possession of the document, of whose
existence they now felt certain, and the discovery
of which, if made by other hands,
would cause such a terrible <i>bouleversement</i> of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
all their cherished plans, had overcome her
prudence.</p>

<p>With such a consummation staring her in
the face, it was no wonder that Mrs. Belassis
was willing to run some risk; but now she
wished she had been more circumspect. She
felt she had put herself at a disadvantage by
this second visit—had laid herself open to
suspicion and contempt; and a fear arose in
her mind that, by showing her hand too
openly, she might have given a clue to others
as to the object of her search.</p>

<p>A little consideration, however, blunted
the edge of this fear. If that letter of old
Maynard’s had not (as she felt certain) been
opened out by other hands than hers, no one
would ever dream of hunting for Philip Debenham’s
last will and testament amongst the
wilderness of books in the library at Ladywell,
which house had never been his home. If anyone
believed that a second will had been made,
they must also believe that it had been destroyed
before now. It was not likely to come
to light eighteen years after the death of the
testator.</p>

<p>Whatever Maud and Mrs. Lorraine believed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
that she (Celia Belassis) came to search for,
they at least would never guess that it was for
her brother-in-law’s will. Of that fear she
might safely rid her mind.</p>

<p>But she could not rid her mind of others.
She knew that Roma Meredith came often
now to read in the great library, and any
day her unconscious choice might light upon
the volume in which the precious paper lay
hidden. Philip was himself something of
a reader and a lover of books, and she had
already heard some talk about rearranging the
library and classifying the works.</p>

<p>Such thoughts as these made her blood run
cold, and very earnestly and intently did she
ponder over the matter, trying to see some
way to rid herself of the haunting dread that
oppressed her. She knew Maud’s trust-money
was all speculated away, and if anything
occurred which should oblige her husband to
deliver up the lump sum, it would be impossible
to avoid a <i>fiasco</i> that must bring the name
of Belassis into open contempt.</p>

<p>What Mrs. Belassis would like best to
do, would be to carry war into the enemy’s
quarters, if only she saw her way to doing it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
She had not at all given up her idea that this
nephew of hers was playing a double part,
and acting unfairly towards the friend to
whom he owed so much. Her own eyes had
convinced her that he was using the money of
his friend as freely as his own; and if he could
do that, of what was he not capable?</p>

<p>She meant to keep her eyes and ears open,
and glean all the information possible upon
this subject. But it was not easy for her to
make discoveries now, because she had declared
open war, as it were, with those at Ladywell,
and was herself looked upon as little better
than a spy.</p>

<p>A spy!</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis repeated the word once or
twice to herself, and an unpleasant smile stole
gradually into her eyes.</p>

<p>Yes, there was certainly something attractive
in the idea. Would it be possible to
introduce a spy into that house, who would
keep watch upon what was going on, listen
and report upon all the talk of the servants’-hall,
and when it was possible, contrive to
hear what was said upstairs as well as down?
Mrs. Belassis had a shrewd notion that servants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
generally contrived to find out the truth
as to what went on in a house, much more
quickly than they were supposed to do; and
she believed that if her nephew was likely to
get himself into trouble, he would probably tell
something of his difficulties to his sister or his
aunt, and then the secret would ooze out below-stairs,
and might be easily made known to
her. She thought she could perhaps set some
rumour afloat herself, which might startle him
from his high and mighty ease, and induce
him to make some admissions to his two
adoring relatives.</p>

<p>And again, if Mrs. Belassis could but introduce
into that house some creature of her
own, great things might be accomplished.
The library books might be gradually and
systematically examined; and if the underling
failed in the quest, surely she could admit her
employer at some unlikely hour, and with time
and patience Mrs. Belassis felt perfectly certain
that she should be able to find Philip Debenham’s
carefully hidden will.</p>

<p>But who was to be the instrument of this
promising plot? A little more consideration,
and that point, too, was settled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>When Mrs. Belassis reached her own house,
she said to the footman who answered her
summons:</p>

<p>‘Send Betsy Long up to my room.’</p>

<p>Her face and voice were so severe, that the
man informed the under-housemaid that ‘she
was going to catch it now, and serve her
right too,’ by which it might be argued that
the young woman was not a special favourite
of his.</p>

<p>Betsy Long was a good-looking, clever
girl, and Mrs. Belassis had already made
use of her as a sort of spy upon the other
servants. It was her pride and boast, that
she always knew exactly what went on in her
kitchen and servants’-hall, and naturally this
knowledge could only be obtained through
one of the servants themselves. The honourable
position of informer-general had been
held for nearly two years by Betsy Long,
who stood high in her mistress’s favour, and
proportionately low in that of her fellow-servants.
Betsy Long could lie with an
assumption of simple veracity that was
touching to witness, and she knew when to
speak and when to hold her peace; and she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
always been faithful, so far, to her mistress,
whom she feared whilst she fawned upon her.
So Betsy Long was selected by Mrs. Belassis
as her chosen instrument.</p>

<p>Betsy came up in fear and trembling, not
knowing what might be in store for her.
She was, however, somewhat reassured by the
look and manner of her mistress; and the two
entered into a long and earnest conference, the
result of which will be seen later. The immediate
result was, that the girl went sobbing
down to the lower regions, with the news that
Mrs. Belassis had turned her off with a week’s
notice, and she didn’t know what would become
of her.</p>

<p>The other servants could hardly be said to
be sympathetic, and told her plainly that it
served her right.</p>

<p>Betsy cried loudly in public, but never in
private; and in spite of her mistress’s supposed
displeasure, she and Mrs. Belassis held,
in strict privacy, more than one long conference
together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis felt easier in her mind now,
as to matters connected with Ladywell; but
she was not easy about the secret she believed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
her husband was hiding from her. She had
so little faith in his acuteness, that she was
convinced he might get into some very unpleasant
mess, if he did not take her into
his confidence. She was angry with him for
his folly and recklessness in plunging himself
into difficulties from which he seemed unable
to extricate himself, and felt aggrieved to have
another burden added to the load she was already
forced to carry; but at the same time she was not
going to stand by and let that stupid husband
of hers keep an important secret from her.</p>

<p>‘Alfred,’ she said sharply, upon the first
favourable opportunity, ‘I asked you once
before what you knew of Whitbury and Miss
Marjory Descartes. You were pleased then
to make a very ungentlemanly reply; perhaps
now you will answer me properly.’</p>

<p>Belassis looked thoroughly frightened and
taken aback.</p>

<p>‘Wh—what do you kn—know about Wh—Whitbury?’
he stammered, his face growing
pale.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know anything yet; but I mean
to know all pretty soon,’ answered Mrs. Belassis
coolly and firmly. ‘You are not such a fool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
as to try and deceive me? You ought to know
by this time that you couldn’t do it.’</p>

<p>‘Why should I know anything of Whitbury?’
asked Belassis, trying all he knew to
speak naturally.</p>

<p>‘Why should you turn perfectly livid at
the bare mention of the name, if you didn’t?’</p>

<p>‘I wasn’t very well that evening—Philip
had startled me by coming in so suddenly
upon us.’</p>

<p>‘Look here, Alfred!’ said Mrs. Belassis
significantly. ‘You know, and what’s more, I
believe Philip Debenham knows, that you have
some mysterious connection with Whitbury.
If you won’t tell me, I shall ask him; and if
he doesn’t satisfy me, I shall apply direct to
Miss Marjory Descartes. I have not any
reason to suppose that she will screen you, if
she knows of anything to your discredit.’</p>

<p>Belassis thus brought to bay, collapsed suddenly
and hopelessly. In encounters with his
wife he invariably got the worst of it.</p>

<p>‘I—I—Indeed, my dear, I should have
told you all long ago, only it seemed useless
to rake up old stories of dead-and-gone follies.
Young men will be young men, you know;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
and boys will be boys. I was little more than
a boy when I went to Whitbury to fish, and I
did get into some little trouble there—money
trouble, I mean—and I dare say if people hadn’t
been good-natured, and not been too hard upon
me, it would have gone rather hardly with
me.’</p>

<p>Belassis, with an air of great good faith,
gave the particulars of the little fraud he had
unsuccessfully perpetrated (to which Miss Marjory
had alluded in talking to Tor), and the
names given, and the circumstantial correctness
of the story, convinced Mrs. Belassis that it was
a true one.</p>

<p>‘And why did Miss Marjory Descartes
stand your friend and beg you off?’ she
asked.</p>

<p>‘Because—because——Well, my dear, the
truth is, I believe, a favourite maid of hers
begged her to do so, and interceded successfully
with her. You see, I—I——’</p>

<p>‘You had made love to the girl, I suppose?’
put in Mrs. Belassis scornfully. ‘Just like
one of your low ways.’</p>

<p>‘I had not seen you, you know, my dear;
and the girl was good-looking, and would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
keep walking by the river in an evening, just
where I was fishing. Of course I paid her a
few compliments on her pretty face, and talked
a little nonsense, as other young men do in
similar circumstances. You needn’t mind that,
Celia, my love! I never looked at another
woman after I knew you!’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis sneered.</p>

<p>‘Do you suppose I am jealous of attentions
you paid to a lady’s-maid thirty or forty years
ago? Was it fear of my displeasure that so
alarmed you? or have you worse to tell?’</p>

<p>‘Worse? Oh no!—no—no! That is all;
the matter began and ended there. You
know all I know now. You see, my dear,
one does not care to have one’s youthful sins
and follies brought to light after all these
years. I dare say it seems foolish to you;
but I am fond of you, and I didn’t care that
a story like that—exaggerated and made worse,
no doubt, by gossiping tongues—should come
to your ears. I shall not mind, now that I
have told you all; but, I confess, I was taken
aback when Philip first spoke of Whitbury,
and people I had known there. I did not
know what ill-natured report he might not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
set afloat. Put yourself in my position a
moment, my dear, and I think you will understand.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well,’ answered Mrs. Belassis impatiently,
‘it is a pity, as you are such a poor
cowardly creature, that you ever had courage
to put yourself in such awkward positions as
you have been doing of late. You can do a
most daring and unscrupulous thing in the
calmest way, so long as detection seems impossible;
but as soon as ever the inevitable
crisis threatens, you are as helpless and
blundering as a child.’</p>

<p>Belassis assented to this criticism meekly
enough, and took a good scolding from his
wife with unusual docility. He was so unutterably
relieved at the credence his story
had obtained, that nothing else disturbed him
much. Mrs. Belassis had certainly accepted
his explanation with all readiness. His nature
was so craven in her eyes that his fear was
easily accounted for; and even she was far
from suspecting him of the terrible and irretrievable
folly of which he had really been
guilty. That he would marry a second wife
without knowing that the first was dead, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
a thought that never crossed her mind for a
moment. She never even suspected that he
had ever been married, until his union with
herself.</p>

<p>Days glided quietly by, and the traveller
returned from his brief visit to Germany. He
did not bring his friend back with him, as had
been half expected in some quarters; but he
announced that Mr. Torwood had started on
a four months’ sea-voyage, and was confidently
expected to return from it with much recruited
health.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis smiled a peculiar smile on
hearing this announcement, and remarked that
she had quite expected some such step as
this—anything to keep his friend away. Her
own theory on the subject was distinctly
strengthened.</p>

<p>On the second day after his return, as Tor
was sauntering leisurely homewards through
the shady lanes, he came across a respectable-looking
girl, sitting by the roadside and
crying bitterly and uncontrollably.</p>

<p>He was too kind-hearted to pass by altogether
unheeding, so he stopped, and asked
the girl what was the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>With a great many sobs, and tears, and
repetitions, the story came out.</p>

<p>She was, or had been, a housemaid at
Thornton House for nearly two years, and
her name was Betsy Long, and she was afraid
she had a quick temper and a saucy tongue.
The mistress had spoken about it more than
once, and she had tried; but some things
would make a saint fly out—and to try and
take away a poor girl’s character!</p>

<p>Recalled to the point, she went on to say
that Mrs. Belassis had missed some money
off her dressing-table, and had accused Betsy
of having taken it. The girl had denied it
strenuously, and had lost her temper, and had
become violent. Mrs. Belassis had discharged
her at a week’s notice, and had declined to
give her a character; and then Betsy, with a
burst of sobs, explained that she had a mother
and sick sister more than half dependent upon
her, and that it would break their hearts to
hear that she had lost her place without the
chance of getting another; for her character
was gone, and she didn’t know what would
become of her.</p>

<p>There was sufficient sincerity in the girl’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
manner to impress Tor with the belief that
she was speaking the truth, and was innocent
of the misdeed of which she had been accused.
He was sorry for her, and thought that Mrs.
Belassis had been hard, as might, perhaps, be
expected from so hard a woman.</p>

<p>‘I will speak to Mrs. Belassis for you,’
he said, after a little reflection. ‘You had
better not give way like that. Come up
to the Manor House this afternoon at five.
We will see if something cannot be done for
you.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, sir—thank you kindly,’ said
Betsy, with a curtsey, drying her eyes.</p>

<p>Tor was not far from Thornton House, so
he turned his steps in that direction, and, at
a corner, encountered Mrs. Belassis, bound for
her own abode.</p>

<p>He lifted his hat and joined her, with a few
words of greeting.</p>

<p>‘I have just met your housemaid in great
trouble at being summarily dismissed from
your service. Has she really been robbing
you?’</p>

<p>‘No; I found out that my husband had
taken the money, unknown to me, and I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
let Betsy know; but at the same time she is
such a saucy, impudent girl, I am quite glad
to be rid of her.’</p>

<p>‘You will not take her back, then?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly not, after such language as she
used.’</p>

<p>‘Had she not some excuse? It was a
serious charge against her. A little heat was
only natural.’</p>

<p>‘Then she must abide by the consequences.
I will have nothing more to do with her. I
can’t bear the girl. I never could.’</p>

<p>‘Will you give her a character?’</p>

<p>‘I shall see about it. I’ll give her one for
impudence if she applies.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think you’re hard upon her?
She says she has relatives partly dependent
upon her.’</p>

<p>‘A mother and a sick sister, I believe she
has; but I don’t see that that’s any business
of mine.’</p>

<p>‘Have you found her a good servant in
other ways? Is she truthful? Does she
work well?’</p>

<p>‘I think those brazen-faced girls do speak
the truth—they have no shame about anything.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
People say that bad-tempered servants
do most work, and I cannot complain of Betsy
upon that score; but I can’t imagine what
earthly reason you can have for taking up her
cause.’</p>

<p>‘I am not aware that I am taking up anyone’s
cause. I merely want to know a few
facts. Betsy Long is a good servant, with a
bad temper; is not that about the state of the
case?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know your idea of a good servant;
mine is that she should know how to keep her
place. If you’re trying to trap me into saying
I’ll have Betsy back again, you’d better save
your breath, for nothing would induce me to
do it. Are you satisfied now?’</p>

<p>‘Perfectly so, thank you; and I will now
wish you good-morning.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis smiled as she walked up the
drive to her own door.</p>

<p>‘I think he has taken the bait,’ she said to
herself. ‘Men are so soft.’</p>

<p>Tor could hardly be said to be soft. He
did not give any special heed to this incident
of the forlorn Betsy; but he felt sufficient
indignation at Mrs. Belassis’ hardness, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
compassion for the girl’s distress, to be wishful
to do something to place her in a better
position.</p>

<p>He told Maud and Aunt Olive what had
occurred, and they at once suggested that a
place might be made for her in the Ladywell
household. They could do with another maid
very well, especially as Maud often wanted
some assistance with her elaborate toilettes;
and she fancied that Betsy was a handy sort
of girl with her fingers, though she had not
given her much work of that kind at Thornton
House.</p>

<p>Anyone upon whom Mrs. Belassis had
trampled, would be sure to be gladly received
by Maud; and under these favourable auspices
Betsy Long entered into service at Ladywell
Manor.</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">s</span> Tor sat at dinner with Maud and
Mrs. Lorraine, about three days
after his return from Germany, a
pencilled note was brought to him, which he
was told had been sent in urgent haste from
Mr. Meredith’s house.</p>

<p>The note was from Roma, and only contained
a few words.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘My father has been taken dangerously ill.
He wants you. Can you come at once?</p>

<p>
‘R. M.’<br >
</p>
</div>

<p>Tor handed the note to Aunt Olive, and
rose from the table.</p>

<p>‘I suppose I must go. I hope it may be
nothing serious. Poor girl! it is a hard thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
for her to be so much alone at a time like this.
I will be back as soon as I can. Good-bye.’</p>

<p>Tor strode rapidly along the path which
led by a cross-cut to Meredith’s house. He
did not much like such a summons, for he
was always in dread of what the blind man
might require of him; but common humanity
forbade him to refuse, when such a message as
that had been despatched; so he walked on,
hoping for the best, and trusting that no very
awkward questions would arise.</p>

<p>He seemed to be expected at the house, for
the servant who admitted him asked no
questions, but led him direct to the sickroom.</p>

<p>As he approached it, the door opened, and
the doctor came out.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Mr. Debenham, I am glad you have
come. My patient seems very impatient for
your arrival. The sight of you will do him
more good than my draught.’</p>

<p>‘Is he seriously ill?’</p>

<p>‘Everything is serious with a man whose
brain and heart are so abnormally irritable as
his. A very slight thing might upset the
balance of reason, or do hopeless mischief to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
the heart. He wants the very closest watching
and most perfect quiet both of mind and
body. With these, I see no reason why he
should not get over this attack; but if he will
work himself up into a fever over any real or
imaginary grievance, I will not give <i>that</i> for
his chance. His daughter seems to understand
him thoroughly. I have great confidence
in her; but the morbidly sensitive
condition of his mind is a very unfavourable
concomitant in his case. I shall look in again
before midnight. Do what you can to quiet
him. If all goes well during the next six
hours, I should say he would do.’</p>

<p>Tor nodded, and went quietly into the
room which the doctor had just quitted.</p>

<p>Michael Meredith lay flat upon his back in
bed, a strange, ghastly pallor upon his face,
and a wandering restlessness in his sightless
eyes. His face helped Tor to realize how ill
he was, better than the doctor’s words had
done. He felt shocked and startled at the
change he beheld in the familiar countenance.</p>

<p>Roma, as white as a marble statue, stood at
the farther side of the bed, bathing her father’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
forehead with eau de Cologne. The room was
pervaded by the odour of strong stimulants
and restoratives. The only light was that of
a carefully-shaded lamp. Hopelessly blind as
Meredith was, he would not permit any glare
of light in his room. Even in moments like
this, he never lost sight of his love for producing
effects.</p>

<p>‘Philip Debenham, you have come. It is
well!’</p>

<p>This was his greeting, as Tor came and
stood beside the bed. The young man took
the cold, powerless hand in his strong grasp,
and uttered a few kindly and cheering words.
There was something reassuring in his strength
and vitality, and he possessed that ready
gentleness which is the almost invariable attribute
of unusual physical power. Father
and daughter both felt the better for his presence
in the room.</p>

<p>Tor gave his hand to Roma, and looked at
her with the grave sympathy of comprehension.
Then he crossed over to her, and placed
a chair beside the bed.</p>

<p>‘Sit down,’ he said, with quiet authority.
‘You must not waste your strength. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
Meredith, I am going to prescribe for your
daughter.’</p>

<p>‘Do so—do so!’ said Meredith, with gentle
satisfaction in his tone. ‘She needs more care
than I can give.’</p>

<p>Roma certainly looked less white and shaken
after she had swallowed the potion Tor mixed
for her. The shock and strain that had tried
her powers so sorely that day, had begun to
make itself felt, and it was time that help
should come.</p>

<p>When Tor came round to his old position
at the bedside, he fancied that Meredith’s face
had changed somewhat for the better. Either
the extreme ghastliness had passed off a little,
or else his eyes had grown used to it.</p>

<p>‘You had better sleep if you can, sir,’
suggested Tor persuasively. ‘I will sit beside
you, if that will be any satisfaction. Sleep
will restore you better than anything;’ and
he drew up a chair and prepared to follow out
his own part of the programme.</p>

<p>‘Stop!’ said Meredith, slowly and softly, as
if speaking were still something of an effort;
‘sleep can wait. Sleep will come later. First
I must set my mind at rest.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>‘Will not you be able to do that better
after you have slept?’ suggested Tor, who
had a distinct dread of what he felt was
coming.</p>

<p>‘No. I cannot sleep yet. Who knows if
I shall ever wake again in this world? I
must set my house in order before I go.’</p>

<p>No response was made to this speech by
either watcher. Tor fancied that the danger
could not be imminent whilst the patient could
talk in this strain. He fancied that men who
really were dying did not make set speeches to
that effect; but Roma’s face quivered pitifully,
and it needed all her strong self-repression to
keep under her emotion. Tor felt a very
great compassion for her in her loneliness and
devotion. All the chivalry of his nature
woke up within him, and urged him to do
what he could to lighten the load which lay
so heavily upon her.</p>

<p>‘Philip Debenham,’ said Michael Meredith
slowly, ‘I withdraw my veto. You have my
consent to your wish.’</p>

<p>Naturally, Tor was at a loss to comprehend
the drift of this remark. All he could say
was:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>‘I am greatly obliged to you, sir.’</p>

<p>Then came a pause. Meredith seemed to
expect the young man to proceed. Tor was
trying hard to remember what it was to which
the blind man alluded—what veto he could
possibly have laid upon any expressed wish of
his. He had been quite prepared to hear some
allusion to Meredith’s wish respecting his
marriage with Roma, but not unnaturally he
failed to recognise the old subject in its new
guise.</p>

<p>‘Young hearts should not be severed. I
have been selfish in my wish to keep my
daughter to myself. Take her now, Philip
Debenham. I yield her up to your care.
Take her with my blessing, and be a good
husband to her, for you have won a pearl
amongst women!’</p>

<p>Tor was too much taken aback to make
any immediate reply. He glanced at Roma,
who sat with hands clasped closely together
like one in pain, her head bent, and her face
covered with blushes, which were those of
misery and humiliation, with nothing in them
of maiden shame or joy.</p>

<p>Tor saw at a glance how matters stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
with her—saw that her position was infinitely
more trying than his; and his one
desire now was to save her as far as possible
from needless pain.</p>

<p>But Michael Meredith must not be agitated.
Agitation meant death to him at such a time
as the present. Tor was perfectly aware of
this, and had no intention of killing the
father before his daughter’s eyes.</p>

<p>Even the short silence which followed his
speech seemed to cause some slight uneasiness
to the sick man.</p>

<p>‘You do not speak—you do not answer!’
he said, with a certain sharpness, and a catch
in his breath which showed how easily he was
agitated.</p>

<p>Tor signed to Roma to give him brandy,
and answered gently enough:</p>

<p>‘If I do not speak, it is not because I do
not feel. I am deeply conscious of the honour
you do me; Roma and I both understand all
that your words mean to us. But whilst you
are so ill, we would rather postpone further
discussion. What has passed already is enough
for us.’</p>

<p>The strained look upon the white face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
relaxed, and the rapid breathing grew more
natural.</p>

<p>‘It is well,’ he said; ‘dutiful, filial, affectionate!
All is very, very well. Roma, give
me your hand.’</p>

<p>She obeyed, rising and standing beside the
bed, opposite to Tor. Her eyes were lowered,
her hand shook a little, yet something in Tor’s
manner took away the keen edge of her pain
and shame.</p>

<p>‘Your hand, Philip Debenham,’ said
Meredith.</p>

<p>Tor placed his own within the sick man’s
feeble clasp, and thus Michael Meredith had
the extreme gratification of joining together
the hand of his daughter Roma, and that of
the man whom he believed to be Philip
Debenham.</p>

<p>‘Bless you, my children!’ he said fervently.</p>

<p>Roma felt compelled to raise her eyes with
imploring deprecation to the young man’s face,
and found that Tor was smiling down upon
her with such a kindly reassurance in his eyes,
that she could but smile back, and feel that he
at least did not misunderstand her.</p>

<p>Their right hands were still joined. Tor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
bent his head over them and kissed—not her
hand, but the empty air.</p>

<p>Michael Meredith smiled slowly.</p>

<p>‘Have you a ring?’ he asked dreamily. ‘I
should like the pledge to be given and received
before my eyes.’</p>

<p>Tor wore Phil’s watch and chain, and there
was upon it, with Mr. Debenham’s seal, a ring
which had belonged to his wife. This he disengaged,
and placed upon the third finger of
Roma’s left hand, with another reassuring
smile.</p>

<p>Michael Meredith fingered the little antique
hoop of chased gold, and his face lighted up
with a peculiarly sweet smile.</p>

<p>‘Kismet!’ he said softly. ‘’Tis the same
ring I sent to Philip Debenham, as a wedding
gift to his wife. How all things have come
round according to my will! Kiss me, Roma,
my child!’</p>

<p>She kissed him silently and passionately;
and almost at once he sank into a calm, health-giving
sleep; and when Tor had watched him
for some considerable time in silence, and saw
how much more natural his face had grown, and
how tranquilly he breathed, he felt convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
that the worst was over, and that the patient
would recover.</p>

<p>For an hour he and Roma had sat silent and
motionless on either side of the bed. Tor had
been considering how best to put the girl at
her ease with him, to show her how completely
he understood the situation, and how little
need there was for her to trouble herself about
the matter. He would arrange everything
with the father when he was in a more fit state
to hear the truth. She was not to be afraid,
for he would make it all right.</p>

<p>This hour of watching gave him ample
time to mature his plan, and at the end of it,
he wrote a few words upon a slip of paper,
and handed it across to Roma.</p>

<p>‘I think I had better see you alone for a
few minutes before I go. Your father seems
much better. Can you leave him for a short
time? I will not detain you long.’</p>

<p>Roma rose at once, after she had read these
words, and quietly crossed the room to the
door, which opened noiselessly. Tor followed
her out, and as soon as she had sent Mr. Meredith’s
servant into his master’s room, she led
the way down to the dining-room, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
some refreshments had been spread for the
watchers.</p>

<p>‘Ah, this is well—this is as it should be,’
said Tor, looking round with some satisfaction.
‘I was summoned away in the midst of
my dinner, Miss Meredith, so I am hungry,
and you ought to be, whether you are or not.
In the character of your affianced husband’—here
he smiled in his frankest way—‘you
must allow me to insist upon your eating
something.’</p>

<p>Roma sat down and poured out the tea,
which was standing ready. She was confused
and unhappy, and Tor was sincerely sorry for
her.</p>

<p>‘Look here, Roma,’ he said, addressing her
in a far more brotherly fashion than he ever
managed to assume towards Maud. ‘I wish
you would not make yourself miserable over
your father’s fancy. I know quite well how it
has all arisen, and it is a pity; but, you know,
it is no bond, really; only I think, just for
the time being, we must humour him by the
fiction of an engagement. I hope it is not
very distasteful to you. We will keep it as
quiet as possible, and I will take the earliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
chance that I can to put matters right. I
know it is hard upon you; but it seems the
only way.’</p>

<p>‘Hard upon me!’ echoed Roma; ‘as if that
mattered! I am his daughter; I would do
anything for him—I must; but you—oh, it
makes me so ashamed!’</p>

<p>‘Why should you be ashamed? You
cannot help the curious bent of your father’s
mind, nor his feebleness, which makes agitation
so bad for him. We must take things as we
find them, and make the best of his eccentricity.
I do not think it is so very bad, after
all. We quite understand one another, and
we can surely be friendly conspirators in our
cause, without being painfully afraid of one
another.’</p>

<p>Roma began to smile in a tremulous sort
of way. ‘You are very good to take it like
that. It might have been so dreadful.’</p>

<p>‘Dreadful for you, no doubt, though hardly
so for me,’ he answered gallantly. Then, to
put her more completely at her ease, he continued
gravely, ‘No, Roma, you need not be
at all afraid of me; for I had lost my heart
before ever I saw you, and it is not mine now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
to give away. I confide in you, because I am
sure that perfect frankness is best between
us; but I must ask you to guard my secret
jealously, for there are reasons why I cannot
make it known as yet to anyone. You see,
you are already my chosen confidante, and my
only one.’</p>

<p>‘Doesn’t Maud know?’</p>

<p>‘No; and you must not tell her, please.’</p>

<p>‘Of course not. I would never say a word
to anyone. But—but—suppose she—<i>she</i> were
to hear something about—about <i>this</i>. Would
she not—I mean, might it not do harm?’</p>

<p>Tor smiled, as though he were not much
afraid.</p>

<p>‘I must risk that. No doubt it can be explained
all in good time. But there is no
need for many people, or any people to know
of this little episode. Your father and you
have very few visitors; and we shall not
be likely to spread the story about. The
servants may get an idea and start a rumour;
but I think that is all we have to fear; and if
you have no objection, I should like to tell
Maud the story. I do not keep secrets from
her, as a general thing.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh yes, tell her. I do not mind a bit. I
think she ought to know.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, I will let her know how it
has happened; and now that we fully understand
one another, and the parts we have to
play, is there anything more that I can do
for you?’</p>

<p>Roma passed her hand across her brow,
with an action that showed both weariness
and bewilderment.</p>

<p>‘Thank you, no—I don’t think so. You
have been very kind, and I am most grateful.
But it seems all so strange; and when I go
back to father—and—and if he talks about
<i>this</i>, what am I to say?’</p>

<p>‘You need say nothing, or hardly anything.
Just let him go on his own way, and think his
own thoughts. Leave the explanation to me
when the right time comes.’</p>

<p>Roma looked at him mournfully.</p>

<p>‘You do not know him—you do not know
what he is like. The right time will never
come. You will never be able to do it without—— Oh,
I can’t guess what will
happen!’</p>

<p>She leaned her forehead upon her clasped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
hands, as if to shut out the vision her imagination
had conjured up.</p>

<p>Tor looked at her with a compassionate
curiosity.</p>

<p>‘I wonder, Miss Meredith, if you will think
my question a very intrusive one. I cannot
help wondering, as I watch you with your
father. It seems to me as though you would
willingly sacrifice your whole future life, rather
than give him one hour’s pain. Do you not
think that, making every allowance for filial
piety, you carry matters rather to an extreme
point?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ answered Roma, very low. ‘For other
women it might be so; but nothing, <i>nothing</i>
can be too great a sacrifice for me to make for
him. I must not shrink from anything.’</p>

<p>‘Why is this so?’ asked Tor.</p>

<p>‘Because,’ and the voice was lower than
ever now—‘because it is through my fault
that he is blind.’</p>

<p>‘I should not have asked the question,’
answered Tor gently, for he saw that she
was much agitated by the tide of recollection
which swept over her. ‘I beg your pardon.
Forget it, and think no more about it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>‘I cannot help thinking—it is never really
out of my thoughts when I am with him. I
will tell you how it was——’</p>

<p>‘Excuse me, Roma, you will do no such
thing. I decline to hear the story. We will
have no more melancholy reminiscences to-night.
Maud will think I am lost if I do
not hasten home soon, and I do not mean to
go until I have seen you take something to
eat and drink. You are as white as a ghost.
Your father will think we have had a quarrel
already, if you go back to him so limp and
spiritless. I am sure he is much better. I
quite believe the worst is now past. These
heart attacks are very alarming whilst they
last, but they are soon over. I will look
round in the morning, and see how you are
both going on; and if you take my advice,
you will not sit up with him. Most likely
he will sleep now, and you ought to get a good
night’s rest too.’</p>

<p>Roma shook her head doubtfully.</p>

<p>‘I don’t feel as if I could sleep.’</p>

<p>‘Why not?’</p>

<p>‘Everything is so strange. I can’t bear
deceiving my father, or seeing you victimized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
like this; and I can’t see any way out
of it.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Meredith, there is no need for you to
see anything at all. All you have to do is
to play your part in the little farce with
which we are humouring him. All the rest
lies with me, and is out of your province
altogether. Leave it to me.’</p>

<p>‘I must; but I dare not think what will
happen.’</p>

<p>‘Nothing will happen. Your father will
yield up his desire to make me his son-in-law,
as quietly and willingly as heart could wish.’</p>

<p>Roma shook her head.</p>

<p>‘You do not know him, Mr. Debenham, or
you would not say so.’</p>

<p>‘It is because I do know him well that I do
say so.’</p>

<p>She made no reply. Tor’s manner was so
conclusive, that it seemed useless to dispute
the point.</p>

<p>‘You are a very wonderful man,’ she said,
after a short pause.</p>

<p>‘Sometimes I think so myself,’ answered
Tor, with a smile; ‘but I assure you, Miss
Meredith, I am not deceiving you. My revelation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
to your father, when the time for it
arrives, shall not cause him any disappointment
or agitation.’</p>

<p>‘And when will that moment arrive?’</p>

<p>‘That I cannot tell. It may be soon, or
may be late—probably not just yet; but it
depends upon circumstances I cannot now
explain. Some day you shall know all, and
in the meantime I must ask you to trust me!’</p>

<p>Roma gave him her hand with her rare
sweet smile, as she said:</p>

<p>‘I should be ungrateful indeed, if I did
not.’</p>

<p>Tor looked down at her as he stood holding
her hand, and said:</p>

<p>‘We shall have to be good friends after
this, I think, Roma. Try and feel towards
me as if I were your big brother, and I will
be a brother to you as far as I know how to
play the part. I never had a sister—I mean,
practically, until I came back a month or so
ago—so that I am new to the part; but I will
play it as well as I can. And you must let me
help you with your father, so far as lies in my
power, and you must not mind deceiving him
a little while for his good.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>‘No, I dare not do otherwise; and I should
like to feel that you were a sort of brother to
me—Philip.’</p>

<p>She spoke the name with a little hesitation,
and he smiled approvingly.</p>

<p>‘That is right. Now I think we understand
one another. I must say good-night;
and hope to see you early to-morrow, and to
hear a good account of your father.’</p>

<p>So Roma went back to her quiet watch
beside the sick man; and Tor strode across
the dewy park to tell his story to Maud.</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">he</span> next few days passed rather like
a dream to Roma. Her father
improved slowly but steadily, the
tranquil and contented condition of his mind
going far towards ensuring his recovery.</p>

<p>Tor came in and out very much as a son of
the house might do, and Meredith was entirely
satisfied. He did not care to talk or discuss
the matter of the sudden betrothal with either
daughter or son-in-law elect. He remained
passively content, and accepted the fact with
the calm superiority characteristic of his habit
of mind, and the two most deeply concerned
were glad that it should be so.</p>

<p>Roma grew to watch with interest for Tor’s
visits, and a strong liking sprang up between
the two so curiously thrown together. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
was not a spark of love (in the ordinary sense
of the word) in this friendship. Roma and
Tor would never grow sentimental over one
another under any circumstances, for the
strange, subtle unity of spirit, which is the
essence of real love, was entirely wanting
between them.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith had, by his injudicious treatment
of the subject, effectually prevented
Roma from feeling anything but aversion for
the husband he had selected, until Tor’s quiet
kindness had overcome her repugnance; and
he had Maud’s image too deeply enshrined
within his heart to spare over-much thought
or admiration for another woman.</p>

<p>But a very friendly understanding was now
arrived at, and Roma was quite willing to
accept Tor as a kind of ‘big brother,’ and
to treat him with a frank cordiality that was
the surest indication of a mind at ease. The
confession which he had made to her, upon the
night of their odd betrothal, had been a wise
one, for it had taken away all sense of embarrassed
discomfort, and given her an interest
in him which she could not otherwise have
indulged. Altogether, an episode which might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
have been very painful and trying, had, by a
little dexterous management on Tor’s part,
led to a more comfortable state of mutual
understanding than had seemed possible at
one time; and Roma gained such confidence
in his skill, as well as in his kindliness, that
she ceased to trouble her head as to how the
matter was to end, feeling certain that he
would clear it up all in good time, and in a
way which would cause no painful shock to
her father’s feelings.</p>

<p>Roma was at work again in her studio
about a week after her father’s sudden illness.
Michael Meredith was downstairs again, sleeping
quietly in his own small study. The girl
had left him, as she could do now, with a mind
at ease, and had returned to her work.</p>

<p>She was modelling a bust of Maud Debenham,
to give to her brother as a token of friendship
and gratitude. Maud had given her a sitting
that morning, and she was anxious to get on
with the work before the next visit, which was
promised for the morrow.</p>

<p>The bust was a great source of delight to
the two girls, and its existence was kept a profound
secret from the intended recipient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>Roma was hard at work upon the clay,
when a servant entered with a card upon a
tray.</p>

<p>‘It is a foreign gentleman to see master,’
was the explanation. ‘He cannot speak hardly
any English. I think he is Italian by his
looks. What shall I do with him? The
master is asleep.’</p>

<p>‘And he must not be disturbed. I must
see the—is he a gentleman, Anne?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, ma’am—I think so, by the looks of
him; but one can never trust those foreign
chaps.’</p>

<p>Roma smiled at this insular prejudice, and
looked down at the card. The name was
written in the fine characters of foreign penmanship—</p>

<p>
<i>Marco Pagliadini.</i><br >
</p>

<p>‘I do not think I remember the name; but
he may be a friend of father’s, from Italy. I
must not send him away,’ said Roma to herself.
Then aloud she added: ‘Show the
gentleman here, Anne, and let me know when
your master is awake.’</p>

<p>A few minutes later, a grave, handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
young Italian was shown in, who bowed low
to Roma with a stately grace, which had nothing
servile in its reverence; and relieved her
at once from the suspicion that the stranger
might be some foreign beggar who had come
to sponge upon her father. This man was
evidently of gentle birth and breeding; and
the girl felt at once at her ease with him.</p>

<p>In her mother’s tongue, which was as familiar
to her as the English she generally spoke,
she greeted him, with the grave and formal
courtesy which sat more naturally upon her
than the freedom of manner permitted in this
country. Roma had spent most of her life in
Italy, and felt herself more at home with her
mother’s countrymen than with her father’s.</p>

<p>She bid Signor Pagliadini be seated, and
explained to him that her father had been ill,
and was still very feeble; that he was now
resting, and she feared to disturb him; but
at the same time he must not be deprived of
the pleasure of a visit like the present, and if
the Signor would be so kind as to wait for
half an hour, her father would be delighted to
see him.</p>

<p>The Signor would be delighted to do so, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
expressed himself concerned to hear of the illness
of Mr. Meredith. In a short time the two
in the studio were talking easily and pleasantly
together.</p>

<p>‘Did you know my father in Italy?’ Roma
asked at length. ‘I am not sure, but I fancy
I have seen your face somewhere.’</p>

<p>‘We may possibly have met, Signorina,’
answered the Italian. ‘For I, too, have been
much in Rome; but I had not the honour
of personal acquaintance with your father
then. I bring with me an introduction from
Signor Mattei in Florence. When he heard that
I proposed to visit England, he insisted that
I should make myself known to the Signor
Meredith, who, he tells me, has been settled
here for some time.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, we have been four years in England,’
answered Roma, with a smile and a sigh; ‘but
I think I like Italy best.’</p>

<p>‘I can understand that well,’ he answered,
looking out into space with his bright, handsome
eyes. ‘There is no country like our
Italy.’</p>

<p>‘No, I think not,’ assented Roma; and
forthwith they fell to discussing its many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
perfections with a one-sided enthusiasm peculiarly
Italian.</p>

<p>Roma meantime studied with a certain
artistic pleasure, the handsome head of the
young foreigner. He had the thick, dark
clustering locks so often seen in Italians, and
his hair was rather longer than an Englishman’s
would be, though not effeminately so.
His eyes looked different colours in different
lights, but they were good eyes, well formed
and expressive, and their long black lashes
and thick arched brows added greatly to their
force and beauty. His features were good and
delicately cut, and the expression of the mouth,
so far as it could be seen through the moustache
and silky black Vandyke beard, was both frank
and sweet. Altogether it was a pleasant face
to look upon, and Roma, who was without
any ‘insular prejudice’ where foreigners were
concerned, felt that she should like this man,
and speculated a little as to who he was, and
what could be the object of his visit.</p>

<p>‘Are these your works of art, may I ask,
Signorina?’ inquired Signor Pagliadini by-and-by.</p>

<p>‘Some are mine, and some are my father’s,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
answered Roma. ‘I have been finishing, as
best I can, those that were left incomplete
when—when he lost his sight. You know
that he has become blind?’</p>

<p>‘Signor Mattei told me so much. I was
grieved to learn it. It must be a sad affliction
to one who loved art so well. I can have
a great sympathy for him, for my eyes have
suffered from a too close attention to etching,
for which work I have a great passion. Even
now I cannot use them quite as I would, and
a strong light tires them.’</p>

<p>And as he spoke he adjusted his <i>pince-nez</i>,
the glasses of which were slightly tinged with
blue.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry,’ said Roma.</p>

<p>‘But it is nothing—a mere trifle. I am
better already, and a little travelling will set
me quite to rights. With the Signor Meredith,
unfortunately, it is not so.’ Then seeing
a look of pain on Roma’s face, he added
quickly, rising at the same time, ‘Is this bust
the Signorina’s work? It is very charming.
May I ask if it is the work of imagination, or a
portrait?’</p>

<p>‘It is an attempt to model a friend of mine,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
Roma answered, smiling. ‘I’m afraid it is
not very successful. It is not half pretty
enough. If you stay any time in this part of
the world, Signor, you will be sure to see
Miss Debenham of Ladywell Manor. You
will then see how much more charming is the
original.’</p>

<p>‘What name did you say, Signorina?’</p>

<p>‘Miss Debenham—Maud Debenham,’ answered
Roma. ‘Perhaps you know her?’</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>‘No; but I think I know her brother. I
knew a Mr. Debenham once—a Mr. Philip
Debenham, who was travelling with his friend,
a Mr.—Mr.— What was the name?’</p>

<p>‘Torwood,’ suggested Roma.</p>

<p>‘Ah yes—that was the name—Mr. Torwood.
I met them in Rome and Naples once. I knew
Mr. Debenham well, but his friend not much.
That accounts for the likeness—I have been
puzzling over that face as I sat here, wondering
of whom it reminded me. I see it all
now. It is like my friend Filippo. So his
sister is a neighbour of yours, is she, Signorina?
Then I may hear news of my friend.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Maud is here certainly,’ answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
Roma, in a half-puzzled way; ‘but she is not
a bit like her brother—not in the very least.
Philip Debenham is here too. He came into
some property not long since, and has been
here about six or eight weeks, I think, taking
possession. You will be sure to see him, if
you stay; but he must have changed very
much since you knew him, for he is not at all
like Maud now.’</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini smiled with a kind of
polite incredulity.</p>

<p>‘I do not think a man can change so much
as you would represent in a few years; but
then likenesses appeal so differently to different
persons. What appears to one a very striking
similarity, another will not even see. There,
no doubt, lies the whole matter.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps,’ answered Roma dubiously; ‘but
I cannot think anyone would see any great
likeness between Philip and Maud Debenham;
for brother and sister, they are strikingly dissimilar—at
least most people think so.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, I may be wrong; but I shall be
delighted to renew my acquaintance with my
good friend. Is Mr. Torwood with him still?
They were constant companions in days of old.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes; but they cannot be so now. Mr.
Torwood is ill, I believe. I think he is trying
German baths or something. Oh yes; and he
has gone on a sea-voyage now. Mr. Debenham
went to Germany a little while ago to
arrange it. I suppose he will come here for a
visit when he is well.’</p>

<p>‘My friend Filippo must miss him. He
used to follow him about like his shadow.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot fancy Philip doing that,’ Roma
said, with a little laugh. ‘He is much too
independent. He seems quite happy here,
though I am sure he is fond of his friend.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose he is too well satisfied with his
accession to wealth and importance, to have
much thought to spare for anything else.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. I should not think he was
that sort of man. I fancy he really liked
travelling about better than he likes living in
one place. But he knows his duty as a landowner,
and I believe he does it very well.
You will find Mr. Debenham very popular
here.’</p>

<p>Roma spoke with some little warmth. She
fancied, she hardly knew why, that the
stranger had thrown some slight disparagement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
upon Philip Debenham, and she did not
approve his tone.</p>

<p>‘I think Mr. Debenham always was
popular,’ assented Signor Pagliadini readily
and pleasantly. ‘I always found him most
interesting and agreeable. I am fond of the
English, I think. I am looking forward to
my stay amongst them. I wonder if I shall
meet any other friends here. I suppose that
would be too much good fortune.’</p>

<p>‘It is not very likely,’ answered Roma.
‘For there are very few people at Ladywell—it
is quite a remote place. Mr. Belassis has
never been abroad, or his family either; and
except for them, there are hardly any more
people just round here.’</p>

<p>A few questions about the Belassis family
and the neighbourhood kept the ball of conversation
going some minutes longer; but the
subject of his friend Philip Debenham was
evidently of much greater interest to the
stranger, as was but natural, and Roma was
telling him a few general facts about the
people at Ladywell, when the maid knocked at
the door to announce that Mr. Meredith was
awake, and would like to see the gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>Roma went to introduce the stranger to her
father, and then she retired, leaving; the two
men to make their own way together.</p>

<p>She had not been long in her studio when a
well-known step came ringing down the long
passage, and she had barely time to fling a
cloth over the bust of Maud, before Tor had
entered, as he now did almost at will, greeting
her in frank, brotherly fashion.</p>

<p>‘Well, Roma, how is the world going with
you to-day? How is your father?’</p>

<p>‘Better, thanks; much more like himself
every day. Have you seen him?’</p>

<p>‘No. I heard a jabber of Italian going on
in his room, so I walked past and came here.
Whom has he got with him to-day?’</p>

<p>‘An Italian gentleman—an old friend of
yours.’</p>

<p>‘Of mine?’</p>

<p>‘So he says. He met you in Italy, and
talks affectionately of his friend Filippo.’</p>

<p>‘The devil he does!’ breathed Tor to himself;
but aloud he said, ‘Very kind of him,
I’m sure. What’s the fellow’s name?’</p>

<p>‘Marco Pagliadini.’</p>

<p>‘Never heard of him, to my knowledge.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>‘You must have a bad memory, for I think
you must have known him quite well
once.’</p>

<p>‘Well, certainly I have known a vast
number of foreign fellows at one time or
another,’ answered Tor, racking his brains in
vain to remember the name of Pagliadini in
connection with Phil or himself, ‘but I
certainly have no recollection of this chap.’</p>

<p>‘You will remember him when you see him,
for he is very good-looking, in an Italian sort
of style.’</p>

<p>Tor was not at all anxious to meet this
fascinating foreigner, and mentally consigned
him to the infernal regions with hearty goodwill.
If he really had known Phil in past
days, he would certainly fail to recognise the
present Philip Debenham, and more likely
than not would be able again to identify him
as Torwood. Altogether, it was as awkward
an incident as could well have occurred, this
sudden advent of the Italian into the Merediths’
household.</p>

<p>‘Might have been another Debenham he
knew,’ suggested Tor, by way of saying
something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>‘It couldn’t be that, because he knew Mr.
Torwood too,’ answered Roma.</p>

<p>Again Tor registered a mental aspiration
that the gentleman and his knowledge might
be consigned to a warmer region than that of
England, and determined more resolutely than
ever to avoid a meeting.</p>

<p>‘Well, I dare say I have met him somewhere;
but he can’t have made a deep impression
upon me, as I have no recollection of
his name. One doesn’t keep all one’s acquaintances
in one’s head for evermore; and
as he might be pained by my oblivion, I’d
better not meet him, I think. Good-bye,
Roma. I’m glad your father is better. I’ll
come and see him some other day, when I’ve
more time.’</p>

<p>‘Must you go now? He will be sorry
not to see you. You have hardly been here
a minute.’</p>

<p>‘Maud wanted me to ride with her as soon
as it grew a little cooler. I think I will do
so now. That Signor will engross your father
quite enough for one day. He ought not to
talk too much, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Won’t you stay and see Signor Pagliadini?’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
asked Roma, rather surprised at his decision.</p>

<p>‘No, thanks; I don’t think I’ll bother about
it. He’ll only detain me longer, and Maud
will be disappointed. I will see you again
soon. No doubt the Italian converse will
cheer your father very much more than my
society could do.’</p>

<p>So Tor took his departure in a more precipitate
fashion than usual, although his ease
of manner did not in any way desert him,
and he laughed and chatted with Roma up
to the moment of his exit. She rather wondered
why he had not stayed to see the
Signor; but men were odd, as Maud had
always impressed upon her, and did not act
as women would do under the same circumstances.</p>

<p>In a short time a summons came for her
to join the gentlemen in Mr. Meredith’s study.
She found that the tea had been carried there;
and when she entered, one glance at her
father’s face showed her how greatly he had
been charmed by the stranger’s visit.</p>

<p>‘Roma, my dear, Signor Pagliadini has
kindly consented to become our guest for a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
days. He comes, as you know, as an intimate
friend of our esteemed relative Alberto Mattei.
It is a greater pleasure, Signor, than you can
well understand, for a man in my isolated
position to receive a visit from one who comes
direct from the land of his fondest dreams—from
the land where the brightest, the happiest
years of his life were spent! Art is my
passion—my deepest delight! and the converse
with one who knows and loves her well
is more to me than you can easily comprehend.
Your ready acceptance of the humble
hospitality which I can offer, has given me
more pleasure than I can well express.’</p>

<p>The stranger made a suitable reply to this
flowery address, showing that the advantage
was all on his side, and the obligation a
very deep one; and after Meredith had made
his rejoinder to this declaration, he turned
again to his daughter.</p>

<p>‘Philip has been here, has he not?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, father.’</p>

<p>‘I heard his step. I knew he had passed
the door twice. How was it he remained so
short a time?’</p>

<p>‘He was in haste, father. He came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
ask after you, but he was going to ride with
Maud.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, he is a kind brother. Did you tell
him Signor Pagliadini was here?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Signor Pagliadini knows Philip.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, so I told him; but he could not
wait. However, he will see him another
day.’</p>

<p>The Italian smiled in rather an odd fashion.</p>

<p>‘My old friend Filippo was not anxious,
then, to renew the acquaintance?’</p>

<p>Roma laughed in her quiet way, rather
amused at what she thought to be his
pique.</p>

<p>‘Philip is a thorough Englishman, Signor,’
she answered, explaining away, as best she
could, what had evidently been taken somewhat
amiss. ‘He goes his own way in his
own fashion, turning neither to right nor left.
He had promised to ride with Maud, and ride
with Maud he would, in defiance of all other
claims upon his time.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, just so; I perceive. The sister stands
always first. It is quite as it should be.’</p>

<p>‘He is very fond of Maud,’ said Roma,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
thinking he was still offended, trying to lead
the conversation into other channels.</p>

<p>‘If she at all resembles the statue which
you are portraying, it is not to be wondered
at, this fraternal devotion.’</p>

<p>‘Maud is very charming,’ said Mr. Meredith;
‘as you will see for yourself some day.’</p>

<p>‘And you will find that Philip is just as
pleasant in his way, when you do meet him,’
continued Roma. ‘You must not mind English
ways when you come to England, Signor.
They are more blunt, perhaps; but I think an
Englishman’s word is worth its weight in
gold!’</p>

<p>The Signor smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>‘My friend Philip Debenham is fortunate
in having such a champion.’</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith laughed, and Roma blushed
suddenly and vividly.</p>

<p>‘We allow our daughters more liberty of
speech and action than do your countrymen,
Signor. Roma has been brought up
<i>à l’Anglaise</i>; and then my daughter has the
right to defend her friend.’</p>

<p>The Signor bowed and smiled, and Roma
blushed still more vividly. She thought it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
bad taste on her father’s part to give so broad
a hint to a perfect stranger, upon private family
affairs.</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini seemed to divine her confusion
without looking at her, and turned the
conversation into new channels. He was certainly
a fascinating talker. Roma listened to
him with more pleasure than she had experienced
for many a long day.</p>

<p>The soft language of her childhood was
like music to her ear, and she listened to the
stories of her native land, and the cities in
which her happy early youth had been passed,
with undivided attention.</p>

<p>Michael Meredith dozed in his chair under
the influence of the low musical voice, and
the Italian spoke on, talking only to Roma,
looking into her fair, pale face, and delighting
with all the artistic feeling within him, in
her rare and perfect beauty of form and
feature.</p>

<p>When the blind man awoke to consciousness,
more than an hour had passed, and yet
his daughter and their guest were still in
earnest converse. A stroll round the dewy
garden after dinner, and some music in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
drawing-room later, closed the day; and
Roma went to bed that night feeling as
though something very strange had happened
to her, and as though some new interest had
unaccountably come into her life. This Italian
with the soft voice and earnest eyes, that
seemed to her half-strange and half-familiar,
interested her more than any man whom she
had met, since her childhood’s dreams had
merged into the more definite ideals of womanhood.</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">or</span> left Michael Meredith’s house
that day with a presentiment that
this visit of Signor Pagliadini
boded no good to him.</p>

<p>He could not account for the feeling altogether,
because by a little dexterous management
it would surely be easy to avoid meeting
this Italian, who would not be likely to remain
more than a single night, or at most two, in
so remote a part as Ladywell. Even if he
did meet the foreigner, he could but brazen
matters out with him as he had done before
with Sir Herbert Moncrieff. He would meet
the man, if meet him he must, alone, and
then there would be no danger that the conversation
would be repeated abroad and reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
other ears. He knew quite well that if Mrs.
Belassis found out that a second old acquaintance
had identified him as Torwood, it would
enable her to come to a conclusion which was
of all things to be avoided. That she already
entertained some suspicions about him, her
visits to his house in his absence plainly
proved. He had been more uneasy than he
cared to show, when he heard of her second
attempt to be left alone in one of the Ladywell
rooms. And the declaration of open enmity,
which she had made in a moment of anger,
seemed to him to indicate that she knew
of something which gave her confidence to
declare war. He had ignored in her presence
any knowledge of her words or actions; but
for all that he felt ill at ease before her.</p>

<p>Next day news came that Signor Pagliadini
was staying at Mr. Meredith’s house,
and was an immense favourite there already.
Maud had been to see Roma, and had seen
him, and been quite captivated by his good
looks and gentle manners. Conversation had
not flowed easily, as her knowledge of Italian
was about on a par with his English; but
Roma had made everything easy, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
the mistress of Ladywell understood that the
Signor was an old friend of Phil’s, she had
asked him up to the Manor House that same
afternoon to see her brother.</p>

<p>‘I thought you would like me to, Phil,’
she said. ‘I know your hospitable ways.’</p>

<p>‘Quite so—yes; I shall be glad to see him,
though I confess I have no recollection of his
name. I may know him when I see him,
perhaps.’</p>

<p>‘I should think you would be sure to do
that. He seemed to know you quite well
once.’</p>

<p>Tor was right enough in denying all recollection
of the Signor’s name. He did not
remember to have heard of a Pagliadini in
connection with Phil; but then Phil had a
way of picking up foreign friends, about whom
Tor never knew much. His easy manners
and facile temperament had made Phil very
popular everywhere. Acquaintances seemed
to crop up round him wherever he went;
and Tor, who, without holding aloof, did not
so easily make friends, had often found himself
almost a stranger to men who for the
moment were quite intimate with Phil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>Pagliadini was probably one of these, and
he would not be likely to admit easily that he
had been mistaken in the two men. Still, if
he was to stay in the neighbourhood, a meeting
was inevitable, and it had better take place
as early as possible. Ladywell Manor was as
good a spot as could be chosen, for a man in
his own house feels himself in a better position
than he can do elsewhere.</p>

<p>On the whole, Tor considered that Maud
had done well to invite the stranger to visit
him this same afternoon.</p>

<p>He contrived without any difficulty that
Maud and Mrs. Lorraine should be out driving
when the Italian appeared; and he received
him alone in the small drawing-room, with an
ease and friendliness of manner which did him
great credit.</p>

<p>Yes, he certainly had known this man somewhere.
The first glance showed him so much.
He could not recall the circumstances of their
former meeting, but there was something undoubtedly
familiar in the face, and in the voice
too, as soon as the stranger spoke.</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini entered, and glanced
round him in a manner which seemed a trifle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
disconcerted. Then he smiled, and took Tor’s
proffered hand.</p>

<p>‘I fear I have misunderstood my friends,
Signor Torwood. I believed it was my friend
Filippo I was to see here. They said you
were ill. I am delighted to see you so far recovered.
You are no doubt a guest here of
the Signor Debenham.’</p>

<p>‘On the contrary, Signor, I am the master
here—Philip Debenham. Mr. Torwood is
certainly ill, I am sorry to say; but I am
not he.’</p>

<p>The Signor received this piece of intelligence
with a little smile and shrug.</p>

<p>‘The Signor is pleased to joke,’ he said. ‘Is
it that we are masquerading?’</p>

<p>‘No, Signor; any masquerading that went
on was in old days, when my friend Torwood
and I used to change names with one another
in a foolish, boyish fashion, which now I
regret. You may have known my friend
under the name of Debenham, but he was
really Torwood; and I am Philip Debenham.’</p>

<p>Tor spoke quietly and firmly; but he did
not like the gleam of distrust that sparkled in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
the stranger’s eyes. Even the tinted glasses
did not conceal from Tor the glance of
astonishment and disdain which was undoubtedly
shot at him. It was evident that
this man might be dangerous, and it behoved
Tor to act towards him with all the firmness
and acuteness which lay in his power.</p>

<p>‘You are perplexed, I see, Signor, by my
statement,’ he said courteously.</p>

<p>‘I am, Signor.’</p>

<p>‘But why so, may I ask? Is it not enough
when I tell you that I and my friend were
more than once foolish and thoughtless enough
to change our names one for the other?
The whole matter lies there, if you can but
see it.’</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini made a little deprecating
foreign bow, as if to apologize for any doubt
he might cast upon his host’s veracity; but
all his grace of manner could not hide from
Tor the distinctly menacing look in those half-concealed
eyes of his.</p>

<p>‘I could see that well enough, Signor,’ he
said, with a certain unpleasant significance in
manner. ‘It certainly seems an odd sort of
amusement for grown men, this interchange of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
names. It does not sound very amusing, or
profitable either. Still, of course, if the
Signor says it was so, why then, without
doubt, so it was. But still, I may be stupid—I
do not see things quickly—I make hillocks
into mountains, very likely, as you English
say; but I cannot understand one thing.’</p>

<p>‘And what may that one thing be?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot understand how it comes about
that your charming sister and my old friend
Filippo—who is, I hear, Mr. Torwood—are so
strikingly alike. Even for brother and sister—which
you say they are not—such a likeness
would be remarkable.’</p>

<p>The Italian was staring hard at him, but
Tor was on his guard, and his face betrayed
nothing. He merely smiled a little.</p>

<p>‘Are you not rather imaginative, Signor?’</p>

<p>‘Not that I am aware of.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t know. It seems so to me.
I have not observed any striking likeness.’</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini smiled a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>‘No, Signor; it is quite to be expected that
you have not.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean, sir?’</p>

<p>Tor liked neither the words nor the tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>‘I mean that near relatives seldom see likenesses,’
he answered, with a reassuring smile.
‘It is strangers who do that, not intimates.’</p>

<p>Tor was silent, thinking out his plan of
action. He was perfectly aware that he was
suspected; he already felt in a great measure
at this man’s mercy, and he believed him to
be, for some unknown reason, his enemy.
He dared not make a confidant of a perfect
stranger, who might be anything, from a spy of
Belassis, upwards; and yet he must endeavour
to keep on friendly terms, and if it were possible
bind him over to silence. If he were to
talk abroad as he was talking here, a catastrophe
would be inevitable.</p>

<p>‘Sit down, Signor,’ he said courteously. ‘I
see I must have some further talk with you.
Let us be frank with one another. Do not be
afraid to speak out. Truth is always the
best. You believe that I am an impostor—is
it not so?’</p>

<p>‘That is your word, not mine, Signor,’ said
the Italian. ‘You know best if the cap fits—as
your proverb goes.’</p>

<p>‘If it is my word,’ returned Tor quickly,
‘it but expresses your own thoughts, unless I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
have very much misread your face and your
words.’</p>

<p>‘What can I think, in the face of these
facts?’ asked the stranger, with the significance
of voice and look which Tor greatly disliked.
‘The Signor puts me in a very awkward position
by asking such questions.’</p>

<p>Tor laughed, in spite of his inward discomfiture.</p>

<p>‘Pardon me, Signor; I think it is you who
put me in an awkward position by your insinuations.
I am sure you cannot mean to
insult me; but if you will think the matter
quietly over, you will see, I think, that what
you would imply about me, is about as great
an insult as one man can offer to another.
You seem to me to suggest that I am playing
an impostor’s part, living in my friend’s house,
trading upon his fortune, adopting his name.
Come, come, Signor Pagliadini, when one
comes to put it all into plain words, I think
you must see for yourself how utterly absurd
and unfounded such an idea must be. Why,
the thing would be impossible!’</p>

<p>‘It has been done before now, I believe,’
answered the stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>Tor drew himself up haughtily.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to say that you accuse me
of doing so great a wrong as this to my best
friend?’</p>

<p>The stranger rose too, and faced Tor with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>‘Will you give me your word of honour
that you are not doing him a great wrong?’</p>

<p>‘I will,’ answered Tor firmly; and he held
his head proudly, as one who knows that he
speaks the truth. ‘I give you my word of
honour, as an Englishman and as a gentleman,
that I have never wronged my friend even in
thought. I would cut off my right hand
sooner than commit a single act dishonourable
to our old friendship!’</p>

<p>The Italian’s face softened somewhat, and
he sat down again with what sounded like a
sigh.</p>

<p>‘Signor,’ he said, with a slight bow, ‘I
accept your word. I must accept such an
asseveration as that. I have been taught to
believe in an Englishman’s word, and I will
try to do so.’</p>

<p>‘I am obliged by your concession, Signor.
It is not a pleasant thing to be doubted or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
suspected, however innocent one may be in
reality. And now that you have done me
the honour to believe me, I will point out to
you how impossible your theory of imposture
must be. If things were as you would have
implied, why should Philip Debenham permit
such a substitution of names and places? If
I were an impostor, surely the true man would
come forward and claim his own.’</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini shot a quick look at him,
and said:</p>

<p>‘Undoubtedly so—<i>if he could</i>.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean, Signor?’</p>

<p>‘I understood your friend was ill.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; so he is.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps that might account for his passive
condition.’</p>

<p>Tor smiled, and shook his head.</p>

<p>‘Hardly likely, if you come to consider
it.’</p>

<p>‘We are not going to re-open the argument,
Signor,’ said the Italian quietly. ‘I
have told you I am satisfied by the pledge you
have given me. Appearances are undoubtedly
against you, but we all know that appearances
are deceptive. Unless circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
force me to a different conclusion, I shall accept
the one I have already arrived at.’</p>

<p>‘And in return, may I ask a personal
favour from you?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly.’</p>

<p>‘May I ask you not to discuss with other
people the circumstances which you deem so
strange? I think you can see for yourself
that to raise a doubt as to my identity would
be at the present moment very unpleasant for
me?’</p>

<p>‘Very,’ assented the Italian drily.</p>

<p>Tor felt disposed to give way to a natural
desire to knock the fellow down; but he controlled
himself, and continued quietly:</p>

<p>‘When Mr. Torwood returns from the
voyage on which he has started for his health,
the whole world is welcome to say what it
likes. When he is here to answer for his
identity, as I can answer for mine, I do not
care one iota for what anybody may please to
say. He and I can convince everyone who
wishes convincing, as to who and what we are.
But whilst he is away, and beyond the reach
even of letters, I would much rather nothing
was said which could raise such a doubt in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
my friend’s mind. Not that I care so very
much about it;’ and here Tor held his head
up proudly. ‘I can hold my own, I flatter
myself, before the world, and in defiance of
any doubts anybody likes to cast upon me.
You are welcome to say and do what you
choose. I am not going to sue to any man;
but I advise you, for your own sake, to take
care what you do, because I am better as a
friend than as an enemy; and I am honest
enough to tell you candidly, that to raise a
doubt as to my right to my name would be
unpleasant for me during Torwood’s absence,
and that if you raise that doubt, you will gain
a tolerably dangerous enemy.’</p>

<p>The Italian was silent awhile. He was,
perhaps, surprised at this sudden outburst.
Tor believed this declaration of strength and
independence had done good to his cause, for
Signor Pagliadini looked at him with more
of respect and less of mockery than he had
done before.</p>

<p>‘Signor Debenham,’ he said gravely, ‘it is
not my wish to cause you any needless annoyance.
I may be puzzled—I may not trust
you altogether as a friend—but I have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
wish to be your enemy. I will not be
treacherous. I will not take you by surprise.
If I have anything to announce to
the world, I will announce it to you first in
private.’</p>

<p>Tor smiled, and bent his head in seemingly
somewhat ironical gratitude. In reality, he
was really grateful for this pledge.</p>

<p>He could carry things off with a high hand
to a certain point; but beyond that he dared
not go. He knew if any enemy of his once
got hold of the idea that this man evidently
possessed (that he was merely masquerading as
Philip Debenham, being in reality Torrington
Torwood)—if Mrs. Belassis, or any enemy of
his, had this idea once put into their minds,
then in truth it would be hard to brazen
out his part. Close cross-examination must
bring out the truth. Beyond a certain point no
cleverness nor coolness could carry him; and
it was something to gain the promise Pagliadini
had voluntarily made. If the worst came
to the worst—if the Italian did discover his
secret, he could but tell him the whole truth,
and throw himself upon his mercy. If he
were really Phil’s friend, he would most likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
be ready to become an ally. If not Phil’s
friend, what interest could he possibly have in
the matter?</p>

<p>These thoughts flashed through Tor’s mind
in a few seconds. He was not, however, going
to show any open gratitude for the admission
just granted. All he said was:</p>

<p>‘I agree with you entirely, Signor. Whatever
passes upon this subject had better be
discussed privately between us two, before
being given to the world at large. And now
that this rather awkward conversation is at
an end, and we have come to a satisfactory
conclusion, will you allow me the pleasure of
showing you round the garden? There is a
good deal worth looking at there.’</p>

<p>The interruption was welcome to both men.
It was not pleasant, after what had just passed,
to sit there facing one another, trying to keep
up a conversation on indifferent subjects.</p>

<p>Whilst walking leisurely upon the terraces
and in the shady shrubbery paths, it was easier
to establish easy relations; and the Italian
showed a great deal of intelligent interest in
all he saw.</p>

<p>He admired the whole place very heartily;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
seemed struck by the knowledge Tor had so
quickly acquired, and was altogether both
friendly and pleasant.</p>

<p>Tor was more and more convinced that he
had known this guest of his before, although
he failed to recall the name. Voice, manner,
and expression all seemed in a manner familiar,
and left an impression upon his mind that he
had liked as well as known the Signor at some
distant date.</p>

<p>When the ladies returned, the men joined
them at their tea, and Maud seemed much
struck by the handsome Italian, and made so
much of him that Tor was half inclined to
feel jealous. Although he could not speak
it, Signor Pagliadini understood English very
fairly, and seemed pleased and flattered by
the way in which she chattered away to
him.</p>

<p>When he had gone, she had a great deal to
say about his handsome eyes, and soft voice,
and courtly manners. Tor was somewhat
silent and absent; but she did not seem to
observe it, and was rather startled by the
sudden way in which he changed the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>‘Maud,’ he said, ‘do you think you and
Aunt Olive would mind very much if I were
to bring some lady-visitors to Ladywell?’</p>

<p>‘Lady-visitors!’ echoed Maud. ‘Why,
Phil, what an odd suggestion from a confirmed
old bachelor like you! Of course we shall
be delighted—we always are delighted to do
your bidding. But who are they? and why
do you want them?’</p>

<p>‘They are Miss Marjory Descartes and her
niece, whose name I forget; but I think I must
include her. I like Miss Marjory immensely,
as you know; and I feel inclined to ask her to
come and spend a week here, before she has
time to forget the favourable impression I
produced upon her in Whitbury.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, dear boy, have her by all means. I
wish you joy,’ answered Maud sweetly and
slily. ‘But, Phil dear, don’t you think she’s
just a little bit <i>old</i> for you?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I must consider the point,’ answered
Tor, with a smile. ‘She is wonderfully
young for her years, and I’m not at all sure
that she couldn’t outwalk you, even now,
Maud, and I know she could beat you at
tennis. However, we will make up our minds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
on that subject later; and in the meantime
you don’t mind my asking her here?’</p>

<p>‘As if I ever minded anything you did,
Phil!’ laughed Maud. ‘I shouldn’t mind if
you turned the whole house into a menagerie,
and brought up young lions in the drawing-room,
if only you’d stay yourself and keep
us in order. Everything is so flat and stale
when you go away. I can’t think how auntie
and I ever lived without you!’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ returned Tor, with a smile that
showed genuine satisfaction, ‘if you don’t
mind who I am, or what I do, so long as I
remain upon the spot, I have not much to
fear.’</p>

<p>‘To fear indeed!’ laughed Maud, laying her
little hands caressingly upon his two shoulders,
and looking up at him with smiling eyes. ‘I
don’t believe you know what fear is, Phil. I
don’t believe you could be afraid of anything
or anybody, you great, big, strong boy. You
are like the everlasting Bayard one gets so
tired of hearing about—<i>sans peur et sans
reproche</i>—only you really are so; and half
the people one hears it said of are nothing of
the kind.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>He bent his head and kissed her on the forehead,
and then strolled off by himself to
think matters over.</p>

<p>His idea of asking Miss Marjory down, was
a sudden inspiration on his part. He had felt
that the present threatened crisis required very
careful watching on his part, and that two
heads were better than one. He had a great
opinion of Miss Marjory’s shrewdness, and was
confident that she would be a zealous partizan
in any cause she had once taken up.</p>

<p>Circumstances prevented him from taking
anyone else into his confidence. Much as he
would be relieved by discussing the position
with Maud or Mrs. Lorraine, he felt that he
must not be weak enough to gratify the
wish.</p>

<p>The fear and anxiety which it would
occasion them, and the embarrassment his
assumed relationship must cause, would be, he
felt, too great a burden to ask them to bear,
and they ought not to be put in so trying a
position. Then every additional person let
into the secret meant additional chances of its
innocent betrayal; and more danger was
certainly to be avoided, not courted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>Miss Marjory, however, did know all, and
had promised her assistance if ever it should
be required; and Tor felt as though that
moment had now come.</p>

<p>So he wrote his letter, explaining what had
occurred, asking Miss Marjory’s opinion as to
the motive the stranger could have had in
accusing him of the imposture, and speculating
whether it was by accident or by design that
he had found his way to Ladywell.</p>

<p>He concluded his letter thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘I do not like to remind you of your promise
to come and help me if danger threatened,
because I do not yet know if there is any real
danger to be apprehended. At the same time
I promised to let you know if anything unforeseen
occurred to disturb me, and that
promise I now fulfil.</p>

<p>‘If you will accept an invitation to Ladywell
for any time you think good to fix, I
shall be more deeply in your debt than even at
present; but I must not trespass too far upon
your kindness, and plead my personal woes
more than circumstances warrant. I will
only add that a visit from you and your niece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
would be more of a pleasure and relief at this
juncture than I can well express.</p>

<p>
‘Yours very sincerely,<br >
‘<span class="smcap">Philip Debenham</span>.’<br >
</p>
</div>

<p>When that letter was written, Tor’s spirits
rose. He had great confidence in Miss Marjory,
and he believed she would come.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">wo</span> days later Mrs. Belassis and
Betsy Long held a secret meeting
under an oak-tree in a secluded
corner of the park.</p>

<p>‘Well, Betsy,’ said the ex-mistress graciously,
‘have you anything to tell me yet?’</p>

<p>‘Well, ma’am, I don’t know as it’s anything
you’ll care to hear; but I can’t help
thinking there’s something odd about the
foreign gentleman as is staying down at Mr.
Meredith’s.’</p>

<p>‘A foreign gentleman?’ repeated Mrs.
Belassis. ‘I have not heard of him. Who
is he?’</p>

<p>‘I suppose he’s a friend of Mr. Meredith’s.
Folks say so. Anyway, he is staying down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
there. But I believe he’s come to see master,
really.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Well, he came to see him two days ago.
He was took into the little drawing-room, and
I was in the big one, doing a bit of dusting
I’d forgotten in the morning; for I knew
Miss Debenham and Mrs. Lorraine had gone
out driving.’</p>

<p>‘Could you hear what passed?’</p>

<p>‘I could hear a good deal; but I couldn’t
understand a word, for ’twas all in some
foreign language—Italian, I suppose; but I’m
quite sure those two gentlemen weren’t
strangers to one another, or they’d never have
gone on as they did.’</p>

<p>‘How did they go on?’</p>

<p>‘Well, they talked and talked, and seemed
to get quite excited-like, and once I thought
they were going to quarrel, and I peeped
through the curtains. There they were, standing
glaring at one another like two wild
beasts; and Mr. Debenham, he had his head
back in that masterful way of his, and was
speaking as proud as proud could be. I
thought the foreign gentleman was a bit scared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
by the look in his eyes, for he seemed to
knock under then; but they went on talking
for ever so long.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think they did quarrel?’</p>

<p>‘If they did, they must have made it up
afterwards, for by-and-by they went round the
garden together, and had tea with the ladies
when they got back. But James, he said as
master looked very grave all dinner-time, and
hardly talked at all.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis pondered over this communication;
but Betsy had not come to the end of
her revelations, and did not give her mistress
much time for thought.</p>

<p>‘There’s something about that foreign gentleman
as master doesn’t like, <i>I</i> know,’ continued
the girl; ‘for he hadn’t long gone before
master shut himself up in his study to write
letters. He was there up till the dressing-bell
rang; and just as I was going in for the
letters, which is part of my work—I collects
them from the ladies and from master, and puts
them in the box ready for the man—I met
him coming out of his room. “There’s only
one letter, Betsy,” he said; and so there was,
and he’d only just finished it, for the ink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
wasn’t hardly dry; and it was addressed to
“Miss Marjory Descartes,” at a place beginning
with W. I can’t remember the name.’</p>

<p>‘Whitbury?’ suggested Mrs. Belassis, looking
aroused and almost excited. ‘Go on,
Betsy; I see you have more to tell. You have
been very clever, and I shall not forget it.’</p>

<p>Betsy curtseyed, and drew a few steps
nearer, as she made her next communication
in a lowered voice.</p>

<p>‘I turned the letter over; and it had been
done up so quickly that the gum hadn’t
hardly stuck. I gave a little pull, and it
came open in my hands.’</p>

<p>A look of intense interest came over Mrs.
Belassis’ face.</p>

<p>‘And you read the letter? What did it
say?’</p>

<p>‘Well, ma’am, I’m no particular scholar,
and the letter was too long for me to read
through. I was in a mortal fear as somebody
would come and catch me. If it hadn’t
been dressing-time, I’d not have dared to do
so much as I did.’</p>

<p>‘Well, go on, Betsy. What did you make
out?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>‘The master, he wrote all about the foreign
gentleman, and I’m main sure he didn’t like
his coming, not a bit. He talked about danger,
and not understanding what was coming, and
ended up by asking the lady to come and see
him. I couldn’t make out no more than that;
but I’m quite sure as it was all about the
strange gentleman, and that master had been
regular put about by his coming.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ said Mrs. Belassis, and said no
more, because her thoughts were too confused
as yet to admit of the interpretation of
words.</p>

<p>Betsy, who saw that she had made an impression,
proceeded to deepen it. She was
enjoying very much her own cleverness, and
the sense of importance that her position gave
to her.</p>

<p>‘I fastened up the letter pretty quick again,
and put it in the box; but I couldn’t get
the thing out of my head. In the evening I
took a walk in the park, as I often do, and
there’s one of the gardeners as has sometimes
come and had a talk with me. He’s a nice
respectable young man, and I don’t mind
having a little chat with him now and again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
Well, ma’am, that evening, as I was waiting
about amongst the trees, watching the shadows
get longer and darker, I thought I saw the
young man a-coming, and I went to meet
him; but when I got close up, why, I saw it
was somebody all muffled up with a great silk
handkerchief, and he seemed sneaking up
towards the house, as if he didn’t want to
be seen. I was behind him, and I came so
soft that he didn’t hear me, and passed by;
but I knew quite well who he was. It was
the gentleman who had been with master in
the afternoon, and it’s my opinion he hung
for hours about the house before he went;
and I’m almost sure I saw him in the shrubbery
last night, too!’</p>

<p>A little cross-examination convinced Mrs.
Belassis that Betsy was speaking the truth,
and she left the girl in a very contemplative
frame of mind, after bidding her keep a sharp
look-out, and notice particularly how often
the stranger visited Ladywell, and how many
private interviews he held with Mr. Debenham.</p>

<p>‘There is something odd about this,’ said
Mrs. Belassis to herself. ‘That foreigner
knows something which Philip wishes hushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
up. That is evident, I think. The point is,
what on earth can Miss Marjory Descartes
have to do with it? If she visits Ladywell,
perhaps I can find that out for myself; meantime
I must leave that question. But I will
see this foreigner. I will call on Michael
Meredith and inquire after him, as he has been
so ill. I do not frequently visit the house;
but I do not see, under the present circumstances,
that my doing so can attract any
suspicion.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis walked on thoughtfully for
awhile, and then added, with an air of determination:</p>

<p>‘Yes, I will go now, morning though it be.
All times are alike to the blind. Perhaps a
little dexterous flattery will induce Meredith
to ask me to luncheon, and then I shall see
this strange guest. I much want some conversation
with him. I wish I could speak
Italian; however, no doubt French will suit
my purpose just as well.’</p>

<p>When Mrs. Belassis had planned a certain
course of action, it was not often that she
failed to carry it through.</p>

<p>The Merediths and the Belassis’ were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
on intimate terms, but there had never been
any coldness between them. Michael Meredith
did not trouble himself with matters which
did not concern him; and Maud’s complaints
about her uncle and aunt never made any
impression upon him, neither did he pay any
heed to the hints he heard dropped from time
to time as to the honesty of the ex-lawyer.
His own finances were not in the hands of
Belassis. He had never heard that his old
friend Debenham had doubted his brother-in-law’s
integrity; and so he had no grudge
against Belassis, and always received his wife
or daughters with his customary gentle <i>empressement</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis could be very suave and
gentle when it suited her purpose; and her
concern over the blind man’s illness, her
anxiety to learn its every detail, and the
interest she evinced in the whole subject, quite
won Meredith’s heart; for if there was one
thing he loved to discuss more than another,
it was himself and his sensations, and a
new and interested listener was an immense
acquisition.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis skilfully led him on to speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
more and more, until the luncheon-bell broke
in upon the interview, and with an apology
for her lengthy visit she rose to depart.</p>

<p>‘No, no, my dear madam; indeed I cannot
permit you to leave so suddenly. Your kind
visit has quite cheered me up. You really
must remain and partake of our simple mid-day
meal. I want to introduce to you my
young friend Signor Pagliadini, who is at
present our guest. He is a most intelligent
young man, quite an acquisition to the
neighbourhood; only, unluckily, he does not
speak English.’</p>

<p>‘Who is he?’ asked Mrs. Belassis, with
interest.</p>

<p>‘A young Italian, of good birth and considerable
wealth, I believe. A relative of my
wife’s, Signor Mattei of Florence, knows him,
and sent him to me with an introduction. He
has known him for many years, and speaks
highly of his talent and love of art.’</p>

<p>‘Is he going to make any stay here?’</p>

<p>‘I do not think his plans are made; but I
hope to induce him to be my guest for some
days to come. Philip, I think, will join with
me in persuading him to remain in our part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
the world; for he knows him well, I find. They
were quite intimate friends, I believe, at one
time.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed!’</p>

<p>‘Yes; he speaks very highly of our dear
Philip, as everyone does. I think my dear
Roma is to be congratulated, as well as Philip,
upon the way in which matters have turned
out.’</p>

<p>‘What!’</p>

<p>‘Ah, did you not know? Well, young
people do like a little bit of mystery and secrecy,
so I must not betray them. However, my dear
madam, we have not grown so old, you and I,
that we have lost our sympathy for the first
romance of a young love. And now, let me
give you my arm to the dining-room, and I
shall then have the pleasure of making known
to you my young Italian friend.’</p>

<p>When Mr. Meredith and his companion
made their quiet entrance into the next room,
Mrs. Belassis caught one glimpse of two dark
heads bent very closely together over a lovely
bunch of roses and heliotrope, which was being
transferred from his hands to hers. The blind
man was no hindrance to any such small passages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
as these; but Roma’s cheeks flamed
crimson when she saw that her father was not
alone, and the ardent look in the young
Italian’s eyes was not lost upon Mrs. Belassis.</p>

<p>The introduction passed off easily, and the
conversation was carried on in French, so as to
be intelligible to Mrs. Belassis.</p>

<p>‘What lovely flowers, Miss Meredith!’ said
their guest, not altogether without malice.
‘Are they from your garden?’</p>

<p>‘I had the honour of presenting them to
Mademoiselle,’ answered the Italian gravely.
‘They came from the garden of my esteemed
friend, M. Debenham.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, have you been to see Philip again?’
asked Meredith. ‘You go there very often.
You must find a great deal to say to one
another.’</p>

<p>‘I have not seen my friend to-day,’ answered
the Signor; ‘but I took the liberty of helping
myself to his flowers without leave.’</p>

<p>‘You have courage, Monsieur,’ remarked
Mrs. Belassis, with rather a keen look.</p>

<p>‘That is a virtue much esteemed in your
country—is it not so, Madame?’ he asked.
‘Or have I taken an unpardonable liberty?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>‘That is for my nephew to decide, not for
me. No doubt you know best how far your
friendship warrants such an act.’</p>

<p>‘Madame is right,’ answered he, meeting her
searching gaze with one equally keen and significant.
‘I think I know how far I may go
with my friend Filippo.’</p>

<p>She could not be certain of it, but she had
an idea that more was meant than met the ear.
Her suspicion that this man knew more of
Philip’s private history than appeared, was
gradually strengthened by what followed.</p>

<p>‘You know my nephew well—is it not so?’</p>

<p>‘I once knew Philip Debenham well, intimately
I might say; but the master of that
great house yonder—I cannot say he is a great
friend of mine.’</p>

<p>‘How do you mean, Monsieur?’</p>

<p>The Italian smiled and shrugged, with a
gesture far more significant than words.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Madame, we all learn the lesson of
life; times change, and friends too—with circumstances
such as these, it is often the case.’</p>

<p>‘Has Philip Debenham changed so much?’</p>

<p>‘So it appears to me; but I may be mistaken.
My memory may be defective.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>‘I do not think Philip could ever have been
so very different from what he is now,’ said
Roma. ‘He strikes me as a man who would
change singularly little. He is so independent
of other people and their opinions.’</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle is perfectly right there,’
answered the Italian. ‘He goes his own way,
without in any way considering what may be
the effect upon others.’</p>

<p>Roma smiled and shook her head. Her
colour was a little warmer than usual. She
was perfectly aware that the Signor was
jealous of Philip Debenham. There was no
need that he should be so; but she could not
tell him that, and she could not be very hard
upon him if he did feel somewhat bitter against
his rival. Roma knew well that this man
loved her, and his love gave her a deep-seated
sense of joy, as well as some embarrassment
and pain.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis, however, put quite a different
interpretation upon his words.</p>

<p>‘Was it always so with him?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘On the contrary, he was once the kindest
and best of friends. This is quite a new
development.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>‘The pride of his new position, perhaps.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; a position such as his must have its
grave difficulties. My friend is very bold,
but I am not sure whether he has not undertaken
more than he can grapple with.’</p>

<p>‘I am quite of that opinion myself,’ said
Mrs. Belassis, still trying to read the face
before her, whilst she grew more and more
convinced that the stranger held the clue to the
mystery whose existence she had only vaguely
guessed. From the readiness he evinced to talk
on the subject, Mrs. Belassis argued that he was
looking out for an ally to assist him in some
attack upon the false friend, and only too ready
was she to support him in such an attempt.</p>

<p>She must contrive to secure a private interview—that
must be the first step; and fortune
certainly favoured her this day, for when she
rose to take her departure, Signor Pagliadini
rose likewise, and begged for the honour of
escorting her to her own house.</p>

<p>Side by side the two newly-made acquaintances
passed out of sight of the house, silent
at first, because a sudden sense of restraint
seemed to have fallen upon them; but even
this silence encouraged Mrs. Belassis in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
theory, and she determined to make a bold
plunge and see the effect.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur,’ she began slowly and significantly,
‘I am quite ready to help you.’</p>

<p>‘Madame is good to say so; but I do not
quite comprehend.’</p>

<p>‘I think that you do, Monsieur.’</p>

<p>They paused by mutual consent, and looked
at one another keenly and steadfastly.</p>

<p>‘Will Madame sit down?’ asked the Italian,
indicating a fallen tree-trunk which lay beside
the hedge. The narrow lane was shady and
secluded, and it was not likely that anyone
would pass by to disturb them. ‘We had
better understand one another. May I ask
in what way Madame proposes to assist
me?’</p>

<p>‘Your object, Monsieur, if I mistake you
not, is to repair some great injustice which my
nephew has committed against his friend. Am
I not right so far as I go?’</p>

<p>‘I will not say that Madame is altogether
deceived; but I should like to know on what
grounds you suspect your nephew.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis hardly knew how to put into
words her vague suspicions. She would much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
rather that her companion suggested the
nature of the injustice. She tried to draw
him out.</p>

<p>‘I have been frank with you, Monsieur, and
have told you that I suspect my nephew. Is
not that enough? It is your turn now to tell
me what it is you have discovered, that will
bear upon our suspicion.’</p>

<p>But the bait did not take.</p>

<p>‘Our suspicion is doubtless the same. I
am aware that one does not like to put it into
words. May I ask further against which of
Mr. Debenham’s friends Madame believes this
injustice to have been done?’</p>

<p>‘Against Mr. Torwood, of course.’</p>

<p>The sudden flash of some emotion, which she
could not fathom, passed over the stranger’s
face as she uttered the name, and convinced
Mrs. Belassis that she had been right in her
surmise.</p>

<p>‘Quite so, Madame. It is his old friend Mr.
Torwood whom he has injured—the friend to
whom he owes so much. Your suspicion is
correct.’</p>

<p>‘Did you know Mr. Torwood once?’</p>

<p>‘Slightly—yes.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>‘Do you know where he is now?’</p>

<p>‘I do.’</p>

<p>A look of triumph gleamed in Mrs. Belassis’
eye.</p>

<p>‘Good,’ she said, with an air of satisfaction.
‘Philip Debenham asserts that he is on board
some sailing-vessel upon a sea-voyage. I do
not believe he is in any such place. I am
convinced that the sea-voyage is simply a
blind.’</p>

<p>‘Madame is again right—perfectly right.
Mr. Torwood is not at sea at present. The
sea-voyage exists only in the vivid imagination
of his friend.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ Mrs. Belassis drew a long breath.
‘Monsieur,’ she said eagerly, ‘tell me, where
is Mr. Torwood?’</p>

<p>‘Madame, you shall know that also in due
time. At present, I may not reveal his
abode.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis hardly felt this check, in her
excitement and triumph.</p>

<p>‘You know where he is, Monsieur? You
could lay your hand upon him at any
moment?’</p>

<p>‘At any moment, Madame. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
time comes the man shall come forward.
Philip Debenham and Torrington Torwood
shall stand face to face.’</p>

<p>‘May I be there to see!’ breathed Mrs.
Belassis; and after a brief pause she added:
‘Is Mr. Torwood in England, then?’</p>

<p>‘He is.’</p>

<p>‘He has escaped from the restraints put
upon him by <i>his friend</i>?’</p>

<p>A curious flash passed over the young man’s
face, as he answered steadily:</p>

<p>‘He has.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis would like to have known
more, but it was now the stranger’s turn to
ask questions.</p>

<p>‘Madame,’ he began, and the tone, although
quite respectful, had in it a certain ring of
authority, which obliged Mrs. Belassis to be
more candid than perhaps she had at first intended,
‘if we are to work together, we must
understand one another. I have a motive in
what I do. A friend of mine has been wronged,
and I am anxious to assist him to his rights
again; my motive for what I do is friendship.
But you do not know Mr. Torwood. Philip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
Debenham is your nephew and near neighbour—why
is it you are so anxious to disgrace
him?’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis was somewhat taken aback by
this home-thrust; but she was equal to the
occasion.</p>

<p>‘I will tell you, Monsieur. As you say, we
must be frank with one another; and I will
not pretend that an abstract love of justice
alone actuates me, for it would not be true, and
you would not believe me. No; I have a
grievance against Philip Debenham, and it is
this. He has been more ungrateful to me
and to my husband than you would believe
possible. He owes us almost everything, for
from the age of ten years, he was adopted by
us, and brought up like our own child. He was
educated abroad by his own wish; and after
eight years of school and college life, we found
him an excellent berth in a merchant’s office.
This not being grand enough for my lord, who
had not a penny of his own, he ran away and
lived for eight years upon the charity of Mr.
Torwood, whom he is now using so badly. Then
he succeeded to a large fortune and property,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
and came back to this place, and has behaved
with studied ingratitude to us ever since,
openly accusing his uncle of frauds, which no
doubt he would have perpetrated himself in
the same situation. I need not say that we
feel such base ingratitude keenly, and that
for my husband’s sake I am justly indignant.
When I find that he is spending Mr. Torwood’s
money almost more freely than his
own, I confess I do wish to see him brought
to book.’</p>

<p>A step came tramping down the lane, and
Tor’s tall figure emerged suddenly into view.
He gave one quick glance at the two persons
seated upon the fallen tree, lifted his hat and
passed by without a word.</p>

<p>‘A handsome man!’ said Mrs. Belassis,
looking after him with an evil light in her
eyes. ‘One would not think, to look at him,
what a load of guilt he was carrying about
with him.’</p>

<p>Tor’s appearance seemed quite to have broken
up the conference. Signor Pagliadini, with a
preoccupied air, made his adieu, and left Mrs.
Belassis to finish her walk alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>‘Spends Torwood’s money almost more
freely than his own,’ slowly repeated the Signor,
in Mrs. Belassis’ French phrasing; and then
he added, in good vigorous English, ‘The
deuce he does!’</p>

<small>MISS MARJORY’S OPINIONS.</small></h2>
</div>


<div class="ddropcapbox"><img class="idropcap"
  src="images/i_ma.jpg" alt="‘A" ></div>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">nd</span> now,’ said Miss Marjory briskly,
‘let me hear what has happened,
or is going to happen, that makes
you so anxious.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory and her niece had arrived at
the Manor House a few hours before; but Tor
had not been able, until now, to secure her undivided
attention. Maud and Mrs. Lorraine
had been so much amused by her conversation,
that it had been impossible to secure any
privacy, and it was only when Miss Marjory’s
enthusiasm over the garden and the hot-houses
had tired out the less comprehending and interested
part of the company, that Tor found
himself alone with his guest.</p>

<p>‘It is so good of you to come so quickly,’
said he, with real gratitude in his tone. ‘I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
feel as though I really did need an ally at the
present threatened crisis. I cannot thank you
enough.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I shall make it worth my while to have
come. I shall leave you laden with spoil, I
can see. There are ever so many things I
have seen already that I want, and haven’t
got. I shall take cuttings innumerable, with
or without your leave. Your orchids make
me break the tenth commandment on the spot.
I think I must put up an orchid-house myself.
Oh yes, I will make a good thing of this visit—never
fear!’</p>

<p>‘If you will let me put up an orchid-house
for you, as a slight——’</p>

<p>‘Stuff and nonsense! I’m not going to let
you do anything ridiculous and romantic.
Too much glass might be more of a hindrance
than a help to the letting of the house in the
future. Now look here—we are alone at last:
tell me what is the matter, and what it is I
can do for you.’</p>

<p>‘The matter is, that a foreign chap has
turned up here—a Signor Pagliadini; he says
he knew Phil and me abroad, and I believe
that’s true enough, for I know his face, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
I can’t recollect him exactly. But he knows,
too—of that I am convinced—who I really am,
and will not swallow the fiction I try to force
upon him. In addition to this, I believe he
has a spite against me and comes with a
motive; and though he doesn’t speak out, I am
pretty certain that he knows a great deal more
than he has any business to, and that he means
mischief.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘By the ugly hints he gives, and by his
significant looks and words. And then I
came upon him and Mrs. Belassis in deep talk
by the roadside; and by the startled look she
cast at me, I know of whom it was they were
talking.’</p>

<p>‘We can soon stop the Belassis’ mouths,’
remarked Miss Marjory grimly. ‘I think
we can give them ample food for meditation
on their own account.’</p>

<p>‘Have you found anything out about the
first wife?’</p>

<p>‘I have found out that in February, 1850,
she was alive and fairly well. I am making
inquiries, and I think I soon shall be able to
ascertain the date of her death; but it strikes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
me that your virtuous uncle has run it very
fine. I should not wonder if he finds himself
in a desperately nasty position.’</p>

<p>‘Something like what I find myself in now,’
said Tor, shaking his head.</p>

<p>‘Now, don’t you get low about it,’ advised
Miss Marjory, with the air of a benignant
Minerva. ‘You’ll never do anything
if you lose heart. For my part, I rise to the
occasion. I know I have a natural talent for
intrigue, though circumstances have not
hitherto been favourable to its development.’</p>

<p>‘I am glad you have,’ smiled Tor, ‘for my
powers seem deserting me. That confounded
Italian—I beg your pardon, but I feel strongly
upon the subject—with his smooth tongue and
offensive hints, bothers me tremendously. I
know he is my enemy, and will injure me if
he can.’</p>

<p>‘Have you ever made an enemy that you
know of?’ asked Miss Marjory.</p>

<p>Tor reflected a little.</p>

<p>‘I shouldn’t say exactly that,’ he answered.
‘I have had occasional disputes with different
men at different times. When my blood is
up, I speak my mind pretty freely, and lay it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
on thick; but then, I don’t think I am easily
roused to wrath, and I have no recollection of
any row likely to have made an eternal enmity
between me and another fellow. No, I have
no clue at all to his motive, but I am quite
certain he has one, and possesses some knowledge
of the truth; he would not go on as he
does, if he was actuated merely by a curiosity
to know why I was called “Torwood” in Italy
and am “Debenham” here. His whole language
and bearing convinces me that he comes here
as an enemy and a spy. And if Mrs. Belassis
once gets a hint as to the true state of the
case, it will be all up with me. I wish I had
never sent Phil away on that voyage.’</p>

<p>‘Why so?’</p>

<p>‘Because, if I could, I would fetch him back
at all risks. I would tell the whole truth—show
my accounts, get you as a witness as to
my motives, and take my chance of a prosecution.
I have Phil’s I O U for a larger sum
than I have yet expended; and although I
have forged his signature, and passed myself
off under a false name, I think I might, by
counsel’s aid, get off pretty easily. But I
don’t choose to risk it, with Phil out of reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
on the high seas. Things would be more complicated,
and disagreeable insinuations might
be cast at me. I wish he had never gone;
but as he has, I must try to hold out these few
months longer, and then, when he is once
back, whether ill or well, he shall come to
Ladywell, and I will abdicate in his favour. I
think I shall have pretty well broken Belassis’
power by that time, and opened the eyes of
the executors. He will never regain the ascendency
he once had here.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, you must certainly hold out. I
will help you. I am sure I can hold the
Belassis faction at bay, if I can do no
more. You are certain that Philip Debenham
has sailed?’</p>

<p>‘Quite certain. I have received, through
Dr. Schneeberger, a letter from his medical
friend under whose care Phil travels. It was
written on board the vessel, and said that the
journey had been safely accomplished, that
Phil had borne it well, though without any
sign of returning powers, and that they were
to sail before midnight. He will be far enough
away by now.’</p>

<p>‘Safely out of Mrs. Belassis’ or the Italian’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
reach, anyway,’ said Miss Marjory. ‘I wonder
who this Italian can be? A spy of hers?’</p>

<p>‘Not possible, I think. He came as a guest
to a Mr. Meredith, a sculptor here, with an introduction
from a relative of theirs in Florence who
has known him for several years. I made, for
my own satisfaction, as many close inquiries as
I could without attracting attention. He says
he knew Philip well, and me slightly; that
he met us in Rome and Naples. I dare say
it is all true enough—indeed it must be, for
he recalls incidents that I remember quite
well, only I don’t remember him.’</p>

<p>‘This is interesting and romantic,’ said
Miss Marjory, fanning herself gently. ‘I will
tackle this fascinating Italian, and see if I
cannot pluck out the heart of his mystery.’</p>

<p>‘I wish you could,’ said Tor.</p>

<p>‘Does he speak English?’</p>

<p>‘No; only Italian and French, so far as I
know.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well, I am old-fashioned enough to
speak Italian. When I was young, it was
the fashion to learn only a few things, and
those well. Girls were not encouraged then
to dabble in science and metaphysics, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
play at atheism and agnosticism when they
should be practising their scales and learning
their catechism. We were not at all learned
young ladies in my day. We didn’t look
down on our parents, sneer at the clergy, or
aspire to the “higher culture” and “higher
morality,” or whatever their new-fangled
jargon may be; but we were taught how to
behave ourselves in the company of our elders,
we did not lounge or yawn when obliged to
listen to conversation rather above our heads,
nor did we interrupt our betters or interfere
whenever we happened to disagree. We did not
talk big about universal equality or socialistic
philanthropy, but I flatter myself we understood
our duty to our neighbour better than
this generation understands it. And I venture
to say I can talk Italian against any modern
young lady extant, however learned she
may be.’</p>

<p>Once get Miss Marjory upon any of her pet
themes, and she was certain to wax eloquent.
Tor was quite content to listen, and the late
experiences he had had of nineteenth-century
culture inclined him to agree with Miss
Marjory’s view of the case. Men are proverbially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
averse to the higher education of
women.</p>

<p>‘Well, Miss Marjory,’ said Tor, ‘you will
have that opportunity to-night; for I have
asked Signor Pagliadini to dine here, and you
will be able to tackle him to your heart’s
content.’</p>

<p>‘To dine here!’ echoed Miss Marjory.
‘Why, I thought you were sworn foes.’</p>

<p>‘Not at all; we are nominally on excellent
terms. In public he has not said one unpleasant
word. It is in a private interview
that he was so disagreeable. Whatever his
motive is, he does not wish to drive me to
strong measures. I believe I shall have fair
warning if he makes up his mind to attack
me.’</p>

<p>‘I will tackle him,’ said Miss Marjory, with
a certain satisfaction in her tone. ‘I flatter
myself I shall be able to discover who he is
and what he wants.’</p>

<p>Tor was quite of the same opinion. He
believed that Miss Marjory could do anything
she had a mind to, and was content
to hand over Signor Pagliadini to her
tender mercies, to be turned inside out, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
submitted to any other process that might
seem good to her.</p>

<p>‘My sister and my aunt do not understand
Italian,’ he went on to say, ‘so that they will
not be a bit the wiser for any conversation
which they may overhear.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, perhaps that is as well,’ said Miss
Marjory.</p>

<p>Ethel Hardcastle and Maud Debenham had
meantime struck up a great friendship, after
the manner of young girls. Ethel was always
ready to admire and adore anyone who was
kind and pretty and good to her; and anything
like a strong will or an originality of
disposition struck her as something peculiarly
desirable. Thus in a couple of hours’ time
the young mistress of Ladywell, with her
frank gracious ways, her fresh, charming face,
and her saucy independent speech, had altogether
bewitched the less-favoured but simple-minded
Ethel, and Maud became the object of
her youthful and generous enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Maud liked to be admired, and therefore she
liked Ethel; and because she liked her, she
waxed confidential; and an acute observer of
human nature might safely aver that a stage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
had already been arrived at when long conversations
in one another’s rooms at night, of
a peculiarly and almost needlessly confidential
character, would become inevitable.</p>

<p>Tor became aware of this sudden friendship
when he arrived in the drawing-room
shortly before the dinner-hour, and found
the two girls deep in talk in a distant
window.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory looked remarkably well—every
inch the gentlewoman she was—in her
rich amber satin and costly lace, which set off
to peculiar advantage her small dark head and
bright animated eyes. She had the distinguished,
high-bred look which seems growing
more and more rare in these modern times,
and which no amount of outward magnificence
can ever simulate.</p>

<p>‘Signor Pagliadini,’ announced the servant,
throwing open the door; and Miss Marjory’s
keen eyes were riveted in a moment upon the
stranger’s face.</p>

<p>He was presented to the guests, and went
through the ceremony with all the ease of indifference.
He had certainly no cause to be
interested in these two ladies, whom he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
never seen before, nor was likely to see
again.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced in a few minutes.
Tor gave his arm to Miss Marjory; Mrs.
Lorraine followed with Ethel; Maud and the
Signor brought up the rear.</p>

<p>‘He is very good-looking,’ said Miss Marjory
softly to her host—‘too good-looking to
be dangerous, I think. Very handsome men
are always rather stupid.’</p>

<p>Tor smiled, and wondered how far this
sweeping statement was true. He was rather
inclined to accept Miss Marjory’s axioms, for
he believed her to be a keen observer of human
nature.</p>

<p>The dinner passed off smoothly. Conversations
in English, French, and Italian were
carried on promiscuously, English predominating
somewhat, as three out of the four ladies
present much preferred their native tongue as
a medium of communication.</p>

<p>Only once did Miss Marjory address any
low-toned observation to Tor, and that was
when the Italian and Maud were laughing very
much together over some anecdote he had just
related.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>Leaning forward slightly, she said in a quiet
undertone:</p>

<p>‘Whether that man speaks English or not,
he understands it as well as you or I.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think so?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think anything about it. I <i>know</i>
it.’</p>

<p>Nothing of interest happened when the
ladies had left the table. The Signor talked
easily and pleasantly of persons and places
that both had known, but made no allusion to
what had passed between them a few days
previously. Tor followed his lead, and was
only too glad to be left in peace. Torwood’s
name was never mentioned between them, and
both seemed quite ready to join the ladies, as
soon as a decent interval had elapsed.</p>

<p>The Italian was willing enough to take
refuge with Miss Marjory as soon as the drawing-room
had been reached. Tor could not
help fancying that he felt some relief at the
presence of strangers, as though he did not
feel disposed to show fight that day, and yet
had no inclination to become too friendly.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory never knew what it was to
want words. English or Italian, it was all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
same to her. She was wont to say of herself
that if she were to be cast away upon a savage
island, she should learn the language in a few
days, so impossible would it be for her to
remain silent.</p>

<p>The Signor seemed pleased by her conversation.
Maud had taken Ethel out into the
garden. Tor was talking to Mrs. Lorraine at
the other end of the great room. There was
nobody to hear what passed between these
two, and Miss Marjory could be charmingly
innocent when she chose.</p>

<p>‘Have you ever been in England before,
Signor?’</p>

<p>There was the least possible hesitation
before the answer came.</p>

<p>‘As a child, Madame, I was here; but I
have little recollection of it.’</p>

<p>‘Was it this part of the world that you
visited then?’</p>

<p>He smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>‘That I cannot say. I cannot remember
well enough.’</p>

<p>‘You have seen London, of course?’</p>

<p>‘I spent one night there on my way here.
That is all my acquaintance with it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>‘You were in a desperate hurry to reach
these remote parts,’ remarked Miss Marjory,
laughing. ‘Most men would not have
hastened away quite so fast from the gaieties
of a London season.’</p>

<p>‘I—I had an introduction to Mr. Meredith,’
answered the stranger with a very slight
embarrassment of manner, which did not
escape Miss Marjory.</p>

<p>‘Well, I imagine the introduction would
have kept,’ she answered lightly. ‘I suppose
the fact of the case is, that you had paid
Homburg or Baden, or Paris perhaps, a long
visit first, and had seen enough of the delights
of life to satiate you for a time. Or perhaps,’
she added slily, ‘you were afraid that your
reputation would reach this place before you,
and scare simple country people, who do not
understand gay doings.’</p>

<p>The young man looked relieved at having
his way made so plain for him. He bowed
and smiled, and remarked with edifying admiration
that the Signora was quite too clever—her
eyes saw through everything, like the
sun at noonday.</p>

<p>‘I always did say my eyes saw a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
farther than other people’s,’ answered Miss
Marjory, with a little laugh. ‘What a charming
man our host is!’ she continued, after a
while. ‘So superior to most young men of
the present day—just as his father was before
him; they are remarkably alike.’</p>

<p>‘You were acquainted, then, with Mr.
Debenham, our good friend’s father?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes; his father and I were great friends.
Like father, like son, you know, Signor. It
is quite so in this case—charming men both.’</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini looked intently at her
through his glasses. Miss Marjory returned
the glance with the frankest possible ease.</p>

<p>‘Think I’ve puzzled him there,’ she remarked
to herself. ‘If the son is so like the
father, he can hardly rank as an impostor.’</p>

<p>‘I did not know Mr.—our friend’s father,’
said the Signor slowly. ‘He is not at all
like his sister.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think not?’ returned Miss Marjory,
in her brisk way. ‘Well, now, I should have
called them quite as much alike as the average
run of brothers and sisters. He is a little
fairer, and is bronzed, of course, by sun and
wind, but they have the same clear skin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
good colouring, the same kind of open foreheads
and well-marked brows; and a wonderful
similarity in disposition, so frank, and
pleasant, and unaffected. Oh yes, no one
can doubt that there is a strong affinity
between them.’</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini sat silent and absorbed.</p>

<p>‘Come, Signor,’ recommenced Miss Marjory,
after a pause, ‘I must not become wearisome
on the subject of my old friend’s children. The
topic cannot be very interesting to you, even
though you are a friend also;’ and without
any effort she shifted the conversation
dexterously this way and that, seemingly quite
at random, as is natural when two strangers
sit down to ‘make talk,’ but with a method
in her apparent aimlessness, of which, however,
her interlocutor was quite unconscious.</p>

<p>They parted on the best of terms, and with
the mutual hope of future meetings.</p>

<p>‘I must have a breath of fresh air before I
am an hour older,’ said Miss Marjory, drawing
a long breath. ‘May I step out a few minutes,
Mr. Debenham, and look at the stars?’</p>

<p>‘We will look at them together,’ said
Tor; and he gave her his arm, and walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
her off, unheeding Maud’s demure look of
congratulation, and gentle pat on the back, as
he passed her. ‘Well,’ he said, as they stood
together in the warm summer night, ‘have
you made out anything?’</p>

<p>‘That man is a spy!’ she answered with
energy and decision. ‘Who and what he is
besides, I have not yet made out; but he is a
spy!’</p>

<p>‘I believe it; but what makes you so
certain?’</p>

<p>‘I am certain because he has not got his
story right. He is masquerading—pretending
to be what he is not, and he is all
confused as to his antecedents. Fancy being
so stupid as to try and play a part without
knowing exactly how to do it, and what to
say—just like a man! Men are such clumsy
creatures! One time he told me he had just
come from Florence, from a Signor Something
who gave him an introduction. Then he
said another time he had been in Rome
until he came here, and had travelled straight
to England; and once he slipped out something
which showed he had been in Germany
quite lately; but he saw he had tripped that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
time, and tried to explain his words away—the
very stupidest thing he could have done,
of course. He didn’t know how many times
he contradicted himself, but I kept count.
Whoever that man is, he is playing a part,
and he is a spy!’</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">iss Marjory</span> was convinced by
the experiences gathered in a few
hours’ time, that Tor’s position
was growing distinctly awkward, and might
easily become dangerous.</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini was a spy—of that she
was fully convinced; though what could be
his motive for playing such a part, or who
could have set him on to do it, still remained
a mystery.</p>

<p>He could hardly be an emissary of Belassis.
If that worthy had discovered the imposition
practised by Tor, he would not have any need
to bring forward a foreigner to expose the
fraud. A much simpler and more effective
way would be to expose it himself, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
could be done, without any great difficulty if
once the clue had been secured.</p>

<p>It was improbable to the last degree that a
stranger, totally unconcerned in the matter,
should give himself all the trouble Signor
Pagliadini was now doing, simply from an
abstract love of justice; yet, if not a creature
of Belassis, nor yet a total stranger, who could
this man possibly be?</p>

<p>Miss Marjory was a shrewd woman; and
although her quick wits often led her to conclusions
for which no logical premises could
be adduced, these same conclusions had a remarkable
way of turning out right in the end,
and therefore she had learned to put a greater
confidence in them than circumstances seemed
always to warrant.</p>

<p>No stranger, Miss Marjory argued, who had
simply known these two Englishmen abroad,
would care two straws about the matter, even
if he did find out that they had made an
exchange of names. He would either think
that he had been mistaken the first time as to
their identity, or else he would conclude that
one was acting for the other, and would never
dream of interfering. Englishmen were all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
more or less mad, he would conclude, and
were best let alone.</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini evidently knew of the
existence of the real Phil, and concluded, not
unnaturally, that an unfair advantage was
being taken of his helplessness. But why he
should interest himself in the matter, and take
Phil’s supposed quarrel upon himself, was a
question which was hard to answer, and the
only theory she could form was conclusively
negatived by Tor.</p>

<p>She suggested to him the doubt, whether it
was possible that Philip Debenham had had
a momentary return of consciousness, and had
gained some vague idea of what was going on.
Might he not (feeling himself helpless and injured)
have believed himself to be a prisoner,
and enlisted the aid of some able-bodied friend
to go and discover the true state of the case,
and do what he could for the absent master,
who was being thus defrauded?</p>

<p>But Tor smiled at such a notion.</p>

<p>Phil and he understood one another far too
well for such a doubt to be possible. Eighteen
years of close friendship could stand a stronger
test than this. If Phil had recovered enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
to realize that Tor had changed their names,
he would understand in a moment that there
was some good reason for such an act, and
would fall into the arrangement with the confiding
placidity of his nature. Besides, the
thing was impossible. The German doctor,
who was the simplest-minded of men, had
promised to give Tor immediate warning of
any change in his friend’s condition. He and
his sister were the only people who had been
near Phil these three months past, until he had
taken the journey; and he knew for certain
that there had been no return to sensibility.
The whole thing was too improbable to
be seriously discussed. The idea that Phil
could for a moment misunderstand him brought
a smile to Tor’s face.</p>

<p>‘If you had seen the way the dear boy leaned
on me, copied me, all but worshipped me, for
eighteen years, you would know as well as I
do, that he would be utterly incapable of mistrusting
me, far less of setting a spy upon
me. It was very absurd of him to make such
a paragon of me; but he did it, and the traditions
of years are not overset in a few days.
Besides, I saw Phil a fortnight ago, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
poor fellow was just as senseless as a log. If
my voice could not rouse him then, I’m convinced
nothing else could do so within the next
ten days. By the end of that time he was on
the seas. I wish now that he were not.’</p>

<p>So that idea of Miss Marjory’s had to be
abandoned, and she was puzzled to find a
substitute.</p>

<p>However, a puzzle was rather a pleasant
form of amusement for Miss Marjory, and she
enjoyed the sense of mystery which surrounded
her. It was quite a novel form of entertainment.</p>

<p>But perplexity did not stop Miss Marjory
from acting. Not a bit of it. She felt perfectly
capable of doing a great deal to hinder
the machinations of the enemy. If he made
himself disagreeable to Tor—well, she would
soon contrive to make herself disagreeable to
him, and Miss Marjory flattered herself that
she could be uncommonly disagreeable when
she had a mind to be.</p>

<p>‘I can be a perfect ogress when I choose,’
she said to herself, with a modest appreciation
of her own merits.</p>

<p>If he enlisted the Belassis faction upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
side, as seemed highly probable, after the private
confidence with Mrs. Belassis which Tor had
surprised—well, if they too joined in the hue-and-cry,
she would very soon silence them.
Miss Marjory did not believe Mr. Belassis would
dare to be a very warm partizan in a cause
which would bring him into antagonism with
her; though his wife, who was in all probability
ignorant of her husband’s early life, would
stand in no awe of anyone; but at the same
time it could not be a very difficult matter to
shut her mouth, and Tor’s ally felt quite equal
to the occasion.</p>

<p>Why Miss Marjory had so warmly espoused
the young man’s cause she could hardly have
explained to herself.</p>

<p>His own rather romantic solicitude over his
friend’s interests had brought him into a
scrape, which he ought to have foreseen from
the first; and it was certainly his own business,
not hers, to get himself clear again.</p>

<p>But then, Miss Marjory had known and
liked Tor’s father, and had taken a fancy to
the young man for his father’s sake. She
had been his first and only confidante as to
the part he was playing, and had promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
her help if it should be needed. He certainly
did stand in need of assistance at this juncture,
and she was not going back on her word
now.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory never did things by halves.
<i>Bis dat, qui cito dat</i>, was a favourite motto of
hers, and certainly she had lost no time so far.
She had come as quickly as she could in
response to his appeal; and now that she
was on the spot, she did not mean to let the
grass grow under her feet.</p>

<p>A long talk with Mrs. Lorraine the following
morning, enlightened her a good deal as to the
Belassis family history; and finding that Aunt
Olive knew already of Mr. Belassis’ first marriage,
she gave her the whole history, and
frankly stated her opinion of that gentleman.
The gentle little widow seemed to enjoy hearing
Miss Marjory’s abuse of him, which is a
sad proof of the ingratitude of the world.</p>

<p>Lewis Belassis came to luncheon. He was
hovering a good deal about Maud during these
last days of nominal uncertainty, notwithstanding
the rebuff he had received. The birthday
was only four days distant, and the whole family
from Thornton House was to dine at Ladywell;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
and in the evening Maud was to hear
her father’s will read, and was, if possible, to
give her answer. She did not tell anyone
what that answer would be, but announced
that it was quite ready.</p>

<p>There was one person, however, in whom she
confided, and that one was Ethel Hardcastle.
Maud’s love-affair, or rather the matter
between her and Lewis, could not by its very
nature be kept a secret. Everybody knew
that her choice had to be made, and Ethel was
favoured by the information that she meant
to refuse her cousin.</p>

<p>For a sudden idea had entered Maud’s
head. She liked Lewis, though she would
not marry him, and she liked Ethel very much;
and it seemed to her that the two were just
made for one another. Lewis was sufficiently
clever and good-looking to please the fancy
of a simple-minded, warm-hearted girl; and
Ethel, with her plump, pink-and-white prettiness
and confiding disposition, would be the
very wife for him—far more really suitable
than Maud herself, who was much too wayward
and independent.</p>

<p>Ethel had confided all her history to Maud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
almost at the first. Her father was in India,
and had married again; but she and Horace
had inherited their mother’s fortune, and had
about three hundred a year each. Miss
Marjory had given them a home for the past
six years, so that much of their money had
accumulated; and Ethel would be a well-dowered
wife for a man of not too ambitious a
mould.</p>

<p>Maud had enlisted Ethel’s sympathies on
behalf of Lewis without any difficulty; and
when she saw him, she was duly impressed by
his appearance, and much touched by the
melancholy glances he cast at the merry, hard-hearted
Maud.</p>

<p>Maud, however, was very gracious to him;
and when the luncheon was ended, invited him
to ride with her and Ethel, which proposition
he accepted with alacrity. In fact, the two
ladies between them made themselves so agreeable,
that he found it hard to tear himself
away; and when he finally did so, it was on
the understanding that he was to come up the
following morning to play at tennis with them,
Maud having challenged him and Ethel to
play against her, single-handed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>Ethel’s artless admiration for Lewis, after
his departure, afforded Maud great satisfaction.
Ethel secretly wondered how it was that some
people were so hard to please, but pulled herself
up with the reflection that Maud was of course
too lovely and delightful to be easily satisfied,
and she could afford to pick and choose.</p>

<p>‘I shouldn’t be half so fastidious,’ she said
to herself. ‘I’m not pretty or clever, or anything
like that; and then no young men ever
do come to Whitbury. It is a stupid place.’</p>

<p>Maud talked a great deal of Lewis, and his
kindness of heart and various good points, and
Ethel listened with avidity.</p>

<p>‘I’m getting quite an old matchmaker,’ said
Maud to herself. ‘How ridiculous it seems
trying to make over one’s cast-off lovers; but
I should like Lewis to get a nice wife. I think
he likes Ethel, and I’m sure she is taken by
him. I can’t see why they shouldn’t marry
and be happy, and then I shall have Lewis off
my mind. For I’ve not been quite easy about
the way I’ve kept him hanging on, though
that’s less my fault than the force of circumstances.’</p>

<p>Maud’s friendliness to Lewis had not passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
unnoticed. Miss Marjory’s sharp eyes had at
once detected it, and Mrs. Lorraine had felt a
passing uneasiness, as she observed the gracious
manner her niece had adopted towards the
cousin, whose fate was trembling in the
balance. Tor, if he observed anything, did
not trouble his head much about it. Such
perfect sympathy existed between him and
Maud that he was certain she never meant to
marry Lewis Belassis.</p>

<p>Whilst the riding-party was out, he and
Miss Marjory paid a visit to Michael Meredith.
She was anxious to learn from the
blind man all she could about the mysterious
foreigner, and to see for herself what manner
of man this egotist and dreamer was.</p>

<p>Tor had related the story of the sick man’s
fancy, and the odd relations that now existed
between him and Roma; and Miss Marjory
had scolded him for being so foolish and
good-natured, always running into awkward
situations for the sake of other people’s
hearts or purses, or what not!</p>

<p>‘As if the matter were not complicated
enough without your going and getting into
an entanglement like this! You’re just like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
your father—very big and strong to look at,
but just as weak really—as weak as—as—well,
as a <i>man</i>. I can’t say more. Men are
all alike. You think you can get easily out
of this scrape as soon as the real Phil Debenham
turns up, do you? How do you know
that? Just as likely as not the girl will have
fallen in love with you by that time. (Now
don’t run away with the idea that you’re very
fascinating or magnificently handsome, because
you’re not—far from it. But you’re just
the big, brown, easy-going, cool-handed
sort of creature that the girls of these days
lose their heads about; and this Roma may
go and do the same, and most likely will.)
And then the crotchety old father may, as likely
as not, declare that after all he prefers you to
the true Phil; if he’s as mad as he seems, he
isn’t a bit to be relied upon. He likes you,
but he may not like your friend; and he
may try to keep you to your word. And
when father and daughter are both hanging
round your neck, metaphorically and
literally, and threatening you with broken
hearts and grey hairs, and all the rest of it,
then you will find what a nice mess you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
made of your affairs, and will, I suppose,
expect me to step in and get you clear of
them.’</p>

<p>Tor, who had made one or two ineffectual
attempts to speak during this tirade, gave up
all hope of stemming the torrent, and ended
by laughing heartily.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Miss Marjory, that is just what I
shall expect. You have drawn my character,
and I will abide by it. I consider it is my
part to get into as many scrapes as I conveniently
can, and yours to pull me out again.
Is it agreed?’</p>

<p>‘It is agreed that you are an impudent boy,
as your father was before you. Stop! Look
through those trees there. Who is that with
our friend the spy? If that is this far-famed
Roma, the daughter will give us less trouble
than the father.’</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini and Roma were sitting
together under the shade of a great beech-tree.
They could only be imperfectly seen
through the network of green leaves that shut
them off from the drive; yet something in
the manner in which they sat, and their
evident absorption in one another, prompted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Miss Marjory’s remark, and gave it distinct
significance.</p>

<p>‘What a good thing!’ said Tor. ‘Old
Meredith likes him very much. And we shall
have him to ourselves, too, this afternoon,
which is another advantage.’</p>

<p>Michael Meredith was charmed with Miss
Marjory, and talked on with extreme affability.
It was so seldom that a stranger sought him
out, as this guest of Philip’s had done, that
he hardly knew how to make enough of the
occasion.</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini’s name, of course, came
up, and Miss Marjory displayed great interest
in him. She had been so delighted by his
talk the previous evening. Who was he?
Was he an old friend of Mr. Meredith’s? He
seemed so well-bred and well-read a young
man, he must be of a good family.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith confessed that he knew very
little of the young man, save that he was an
old friend of one of his wife’s relatives. He
brought an introduction from Signor Mattei,
who had spoken of him as a young man of
rank and fortune, but beyond that he had no
knowledge of his antecedents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>Miss Marjory, secure in her unimpeachable
position, could ask a great many questions
quite naturally, which would excite suspicion
from anyone less generally vivacious and
talkative. It seemed only right for her to
ask a dozen questions, and make a hundred
comments, where other people would have
hardly a word to say; and whilst Mr. Meredith
was perfectly unconscious of being
cross-examined, Miss Marjory had elicited
the information that he knew nothing whatever
about the mysterious stranger, except
what that gentleman chose to tell him.</p>

<p>‘As for his introduction,’ said she afterwards
to Tor, ‘we all know what an introduction
is worth, when a man has a motive in
getting one. I could get an introduction from
the man in the moon, I haven’t a doubt, if
once I made up my mind to have one.’</p>

<p>‘I believe you could,’ answered Tor.</p>

<p>Whereat Miss Marjory laughed, and told
him that he ought to be ashamed of making
game of an old woman.</p>

<p>Certainly Tor had a warm partizan in Miss
Marjory. Whatever she did, was done with
a will; and when she once became interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
in any cause, she worked for it heart and
soul.</p>

<p>Maud was her next victim. She was not
quite sure whether she was good enough for
her favourite Tor, and wished to satisfy
herself upon the point. For even if not
entirely what she should be, she might be
moulded to a better frame; and if Tor’s mind
was made up—if he must have Maud and
nobody else—Maud he should have, and Lewis
Belassis should be made to go to the wall.
Under existing circumstances, she could in
no case be allowed to engage herself to her
cousin.</p>

<p>Maud liked Miss Marjory, and was quite
ready to come and sit by her after dinner,
before Tor joined them. Mrs. Lorraine was
teaching Ethel some new stitch in crewels.</p>

<p>‘So your birthday is just imminent, is it,
Maud? You should have let me know earlier,
that I might have come provided. However,
I dare say I can find something in my dressing-case
which will supply the deficiency. We
shall see. Old-fashioned things are coming
into fashion again, I hear. Have you caught
the mania yet?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Miss Marjory, you are too good!’ cried
Maud, laughing and blushing. ‘I think they
are perfectly lovely—everyone does now!’</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, we must see. Old ornaments or
old lace. I wonder if I ought to think of an
approaching wedding, too?’</p>

<p>Maud’s eyes looked mischievous, her mouth
demure. She shook her head gravely.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Miss Marjory, you want to make me
commit myself. You are just as curious as
anybody else, I see. You know I am not
bound to give my answer till the 24th.’</p>

<p>‘No; and I am not even curious about it.
I know already what it will be.’</p>

<p>‘Has Ethel——?’</p>

<p>‘Ethel has told me nothing. You have
told me.’</p>

<p>‘What have I told you?’</p>

<p>‘That a girl of your nature and your name
would look higher than <i>that</i>. Philip Debenham’s
sister will never marry Alfred Belassis.’</p>

<p>Maud laughed again, and came closer to
Miss Marjory, laying one hand confidingly in
hers, with a pretty, childlike gesture that was
half a caress.</p>

<p>‘Miss Marjory, you have guessed quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
right. I really couldn’t. I have thought of
everything a hundred times over, but I can’t
bring my mind to it. Once I thought I
could. A little while back I quite fancied it
would come to that; but now that I have seen
Phil—oh no! I really couldn’t!’</p>

<p>‘What has Phil to do with it? Doesn’t he
approve?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it isn’t that! Phil does not interfere.
I know he doesn’t like the Belassis’; but he is
a dear boy, and would not stand in my way,
if he thought my happiness depended upon it.
But it is since I’ve known Phil that I’ve felt
as I do.’</p>

<p>‘Felt what?’</p>

<p>‘Why, what men can be and sometimes are.
You see,’ she continued naively, ‘I used to
have a very poor opinion of them. You know,
Uncle Belassis and Lewis, and old Mr. Meredith,
and a cross old great-uncle of ours, were
the chief specimens I had seen; and really
amongst them, and the few local youths I
used to meet at the mild entertainments of the
neighbourhood, Lewis ranked quite as a
bright and shining light. I used to wonder
how it was real live men were so different from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
men in books, but I did not believe till he
came that they were really bold and manly,
and—well, like Phil is, you know.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory smiled.</p>

<p>‘So Phil came upon you quite as a revelation?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, just that,’ answered Maud, with her
bright enthusiasm, which found favour in the
eyes of her listener. ‘After I had seen Phil,
and felt what it was to have a brother of
one’s very own like him, why, then I couldn’t
fancy Lewis any more—I really couldn’t.
And I should hate and detest to be made into
a Belassis!’</p>

<p>‘My dear,’ said Miss Marjory warmly, ‘I
think you have judged very wisely. And
after your final decision has been formally
registered, your brother and I must see if we
cannot find you a husband, the very counterpart
of himself.’</p>

<p>Maud laughed, and shook her head.</p>

<p>‘You are very clever, Miss Marjory, and
Phil is very good; but I’m afraid, with all
your cleverness and goodness, you’ll never
manage that.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be too sure,’ returned Miss Marjory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
with a very wise, not to say mysterious,
look. ‘I have a faculty for managing
anything I have once set my mind upon,
which may surprise you one of these days,
as it has surprised wiser people before
you.’</p>

<p>‘You are very like a sphinx, Miss Marjory.
Please condescend to tell me some
more, and that more plainly.’</p>

<p>‘Well, if you must know, it would not
much surprise me, if, when Mr. Torwood turns
up, you found him almost as much of a paragon
as your pattern and idol, Phil.’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Torwood! Oh, Miss Marjory, do you
know him? What is he like? and when is
he coming?’</p>

<p>‘What a number of questions at once! You
are as bad as I am, Maud. I don’t know when
he is coming back, because nobody can tell
when he will be well again; but I do know
something about him; and his father was a
very old friend of mine. I believe he takes
after his father, from all I hear; and if so,
my advice to you, my dear, is this: don’t
engage yourself to Lewis Belassis until you
have seen Torrington Torwood.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>Maud looked hard at Miss Marjory, half
smiling, half perplexed.</p>

<p>‘I don’t quite understand you—you seem
in a dreadfully match-making frame of mind.
But Phil thinks so very much of your opinion,
that he has made me do the same. I will take
your advice, Miss Marjory.’</p>

<small>AN AGREEABLE DINNER.</small></h2>
</div>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">aud’s</span> birthday had come at last—the
important four-and-twentieth
anniversary, which completed her
long minority.</p>

<p>She had requested that there should be no
great ‘fuss’ upon the day. She did not want
any festivities set on foot, or a number of
guests to entertain. It would be much more
of a treat to her, she said, to have ‘a good
long day with Phil;’ and in the evening was
the necessary dinner-party, to which the
Belassis household was invited, which was to
be followed by the reading of Mr. Debenham’s
will.</p>

<p>Maud’s decision would be asked at the close,
and it was generally understood that her mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
was made up, although opinions differed as to
what was the decision arrived at.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Belassis were distinctly
anxious, now that the final moment had come.
They had terrible misgivings as to the validity
of the will which they were about to produce,
and could not rid themselves of the ghastly
notion, that at the last moment their terrible
nephew might coolly produce a later document,
and demand instant restitution of the
trust-money, principal and interest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis was certain that no formal or
public search had been made in the library;
but she could have no confidence, until the
will was in her own hands, that some evil
chance might not discover it to the very people
whose knowledge of its existence was most to
be deplored.</p>

<p>Increased uneasiness had fallen upon Mrs.
Belassis, she hardly knew why, by the knowledge
that Miss Marjory Descartes was a guest
at Ladywell. Personally she was rather glad
of this, for on thinking over the conversation
with her husband, she was not entirely satisfied
with the explanation he had given her of
his connection with Whitbury and she looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
forward with a mixture of malice and curiosity
to the meeting between them, which she would
now witness. Yet some instinct warned her
that Miss Marjory’s visit to her nephew boded
them no good; and she was made additionally
uneasy by the hints dropped by her spy, of
the long consultations now going on in the
house.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Belassis did not give way to
dejection. She felt she had a game offensive
as well as defensive to play, and she believed
that she would find an able supporter in
Signor Pagliadini.</p>

<p>‘Once let this decision be made, and I shall
know how to act,’ she said many times to herself.
‘If Maud refuses Lewis, then there is no
longer any reason to temporize. I shall worm
the truth out of that Italian, and then carry
open war into the enemy’s quarters.’</p>

<p>Mr. Belassis was miserable and anxious,
but he was not in his wife’s confidence, and he
did not know what schemes of vengeance
were brewing. He did not know the close
proximity of his old friend Miss Marjory
Descartes; had he done so, he would have
been tenfold more miserable and cowed. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
wife, by a little dexterous management, had
contrived that the names of the guests at
Ladywell should not be mentioned in his
hearing, for she was anxious that the meeting
with Miss Marjory should take him unawares;
besides which, she knew he was quite capable
of shamming illness, just to escape the encounter,
if it was not to his mind. The more
she had thought about his behaviour when
first he heard Whitbury named, and the story
he had told her of his doings there, the more
she grew convinced that she had not been told
the whole truth.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory was delighted to think that
she should at last be brought face to face with
the redoubtable Belassis. She knew all about
the theory of the destroyed will, and Mr.
Debenham’s impoverished fortunes, and was
not at all prepared to spare him. Being a
woman of a business-like turn, and one who
knew a good deal more than Tor did of the
ways of the world, she understood better than
he had done, how Belassis had managed to
possess himself of Mr. Debenham’s money,
and enrich himself at his client’s expense;
and she was inclined to think that a lawsuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
against him should be set on foot even
now.</p>

<p>Tor, however, did not see where the needful
evidence was to come from, as Belassis had had
the handling of all the papers; moreover, that
was a question for the real Phil to consider,
not for him to settle; and in this verdict
Miss Marjory could not but agree.</p>

<p>‘It’s a sad pity you are not the real master
here,’ she said. ‘I believe you are twice the
man that Phil of yours will turn out to be.
It will be too bad if that old scoundrel gets off
scot-free. However, I think I can touch him
up a little. I shall certainly lay myself out
to be agreeable to him. Mind you put me
opposite to him at table. I think I can make
the time pass very pleasantly for him.’</p>

<p>Tor was mean enough to feel a sort of
amused compassion for Miss Marjory’s prospective
victim.</p>

<p>‘You will not let out about the first wife,
will you, Miss Marjory?’ he said. ‘I know
he deserves everything you can give him; but
there will be the wife and family at table, and
a dinner-party isn’t quite——’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be so dense, Philip Debenham. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
hope I know what to say and what to leave
unsaid in a mixed company,’ interrupted Miss
Marjory sharply. ‘Do you suppose I want
everyone to be covered with confusion? You
are just like a man; you think nothing can be
said unless it is regularly set down in black and
white. Trust me. I will say nothing which
anybody else could take exception to. But
I’ll just roast Belassis.’</p>

<p>‘I believe you will,’ returned Tor. ‘Well,
he’s too big a scoundrel to waste pity on. I
hand him over to your tender mercies.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory smiled.</p>

<p>‘You and I can enjoy it—and he. Nobody
else will understand.’ Then, after a pause,
she added: ‘Is it only a family party? or
are any strangers coming?’</p>

<p>‘I asked the Merediths, and their guest.
I saw the old boy expected to be included in
a family gathering. He accepted at once, but
now his doctor has forbidden him to come, and
Roma remains with him; but that Italian fellow
holds to his engagement. Odd, isn’t it?—sticking
himself into a party where he must
know he is not wanted.’</p>

<p>‘Odd and significant,’ answered Miss Marjory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
thoughtfully. ‘I know that man means
mischief.’</p>

<p>‘I half think so, too,’ assented Tor. ‘I
have been wondering how I could win him
over. He can’t have any very powerful motive
for making himself disagreeable to me. Do
you think if I asked him to spend a few days
at Ladywell, it might bring him to a more
amiable frame of mind? As a guest in my
house, he could hardly plot against me; and if
he could be won over, he might speak out,
and in the end be taken into our confidence.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory considered this new idea.</p>

<p>‘I think it might do,’ she said. ‘I should
like to see more of him, and make out
what manner of man he is. I am not at all
satisfied about him; and I don’t think it
would be a bad move to have him here. We
could examine him at our leisure, and, as you
say, if he has any feelings at all of honour, he
will hardly dare to make insinuations against
you, whilst partaking of your hospitality.’</p>

<p>This conversation took place early in the
day. Half-past seven was the hour fixed for
dinner, and soon after seven the guests began
to assemble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>Matilda and Bertha were eager to see Maud’s
presents, and went into raptures over the costly
and elegant trifles which stood upon a table,
‘on view.’</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Belassis had brought a handsome
dressing-case, as a sort of peace-offering.
It was certainly right for Maud to possess
it, as it had been her mother’s once; but she did
not know that, and half shrank from accepting
anything so costly from people she liked so little.</p>

<p>Tor did not look quite pleased either; but
Mrs. Lorraine was equal to the occasion. She
recognised the old heirloom—for an heirloom
it was, although it had been ‘done up like
new,’ in the usual Belassis good taste.</p>

<p>‘Our grandmother’s dressing-case!’ she exclaimed,
with a look of pleasure. ‘It was your
mother’s too, dear Maud. I have been wondering
how it was that it was not restored to
you before. I see now that it was waiting
for your majority. Ah, the dear old box!
We do not see things like it now. It was such
a favourite with your mother, Maud.’</p>

<p>And after hearing this, Maud was able to
turn and thank Mr. and Mrs. Belassis for their
gift, without any embarrassment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>The party was seated, and rather stiff talk
was passing between the relatives, who had
not met in this friendly fashion for a long
time. Suddenly and quietly the door was
opened, and Miss Marjory entered, her amber
satin, lace, and diamonds giving her an imposing
appearance, in spite of her short stature.</p>

<p>Maud thought she looked just like a fairy
godmother, with her yellow dress, bright eyes
and resolute determined manner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis eyed her curiously, not altogether
liking the first impression she received.</p>

<p>Mr. Belassis’ jaw dropped, and the florid
colour faded slowly from his face.</p>

<p>Tor advanced and introduced the guest to
his aunt and uncle, and Miss Marjory’s bow
included the whole party, as she gracefully
subsided into a seat, and looked smilingly at
the wretched Belassis.</p>

<p>‘Surely we are not strangers to one another,
Mr. Belassis. I thought the name was too
uncommon to deceive me. A second Alfred
Belassis, a contemporary, would be too remarkable
a phenomenon. I hope you are
quite well?’</p>

<p>‘Quite, thank you,’ muttered Belassis, feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
delightfully conscious that his wife’s eye
was upon him.</p>

<p>‘You have not visited Whitbury lately, I
think?’ went on Miss Marjory pleasantly.</p>

<p>‘N—no, not lately.’</p>

<p>‘I do not think I have seen you since you
were quite a young man; still, I am sure I
should know you anywhere.’</p>

<p>People were just beginning to wake up to
the consciousness that Mr. Belassis was ill at
ease, when the dinner was announced.</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini had come two minutes
earlier, and now offered his arm to Miss Marjory.
Tor took in Mrs. Belassis, Mr. Belassis
paired off with Maud, and gladly remained
behind with her till the rest had gone.</p>

<p>‘I did not know you knew Miss Marjory
Descartes. Is she not delightful?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, very!—yes, quite so—delightful! I
only knew her a little, and that was ages
ago.’</p>

<p>‘She seems to remember you very well,’
said Maud innocently. ‘You must have made
a great impression.’</p>

<p>Mr. Belassis coughed and stumbled, as he
followed the company downstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>Miss Marjory’s tongue did good service in
making conversation flow freely at table that
day. It was an oddly-assorted company, and
an effort was needed before the appropriate
air of festivity could be attained.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Belassis distrusted one another,
and were at all but open enmity with their
hosts. Signor Pagliadini was a stranger, a
foreigner, and a supposed spy. Miss Marjory
was just the one woman upon earth Belassis
most feared to meet. Lewis was awaiting dismissal
at Maud’s hands in the course of the
evening. Almost everyone at table had good
cause to fear or distrust some one or more
of the company; and with all these conflicting
elements, it was not easy to make talk
run smoothly.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory, however, was not to be
daunted by any such trivial difficulties as
these, and Tor backed her up boldly. When
the ice was once broken, there was not the
same necessity for exertion. People began to
talk to their neighbours, and a pleasant hum
took the place of the first silence, and grew
louder as time went on. Miss Marjory
felt at liberty to talk to her neighbours, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
to amuse herself, now that she had accomplished
her more difficult task.</p>

<p>‘You understand English remarkably
well, Signor,’ she observed suddenly to her
partner. ‘It is very odd that you do not
speak it.’</p>

<p>She spoke in English herself; but his
answer was in French.</p>

<p>‘Madame flatters me!’</p>

<p>‘Stuff and nonsense! I never flatter anybody.
Anyone can see by your face that you
can understand every word that passes.’</p>

<p>‘Pardon, Madame——’</p>

<p>‘And what’s more,’ continued Miss Marjory
relentlessly, ‘I don’t believe you’re an Italian
at all!’</p>

<p>‘Mais, Madame——’</p>

<p>‘Now don’t be affected, and don’t tell me
lies. If you don’t choose to speak the truth,
you’d better keep quiet. I detest mysteries
and heroics! Why can’t you speak out at
once, and say who you are, and what you’ve
come for?’</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini looked tremendously taken
aback by this sudden and most unexpected
attack. He was silent, and the little deprecatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
shrug he gave, foreign as it was, produced
no impression upon Miss Marjory.</p>

<p>‘I believe he’s an Englishman,’ she said to
herself. ‘A foreigner would always have something
to say. No Frenchman nor Italian
would be shut up like that, nor take an accusation
so quietly. Who in the world can
he be? Can some family lawyer have got an
inkling of the truth, and have sent a spy into
the camp? I don’t believe lawyers out of
novels do things like that. I wonder if the
Belassis party are at the bottom of it? I
begin to think they must be. Well, I will
make it warm for them if they are troublesome.’</p>

<p>With her most agreeable smile, Miss Marjory
now looked across at her opposite neighbour.</p>

<p>‘Have you never paid Whitbury a visit all
these past thirty years, Mr. Belassis?’ she
asked sweetly. ‘Surely you cannot have forgotten
us so utterly as that? You were so
enthusiastic about the place when you were
there. Have you never been there since?’</p>

<p>‘No—in fact—you see, I had very much
to occupy my time;’ and he looked at Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
Marjory with a sort of helpless entreaty, which
she was hard-hearted enough to enjoy.</p>

<p>‘You left so suddenly, too, without even
making your adieux! There was quite an
excitement about your sudden flight and expected
return. Nobody dreamed you had gone
for good.’</p>

<p>‘There was no particular—reason—why I
should return,’ hesitated Belassis, trying to
put a bold face upon the matter.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed!’ returned Miss Marjory significantly;
‘I should have thought there was
an excellent reason.’</p>

<p>Belassis was silent, and his plate stood
before him untouched. What would not that
dreadful woman say next? He was ready to
wish that the earth would open and swallow
him up! The earth, however, as is usual in
such cases, showed no disposition to espouse
him or his cause.</p>

<p>People had a way of listening when Miss
Marjory spoke, and her last observation had
been heard by one or two, who seemed idly
waiting for what would follow. Miss Marjory
was quite equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>‘I fancied, perhaps, you had relatives there,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
she went on carelessly. ‘There is a Belassis
living in the town, but it may be another
family, of course. He is in trade, and doing
a good business.’</p>

<p>Mr. Belassis had turned so yellow that
even Miss Marjory thought she had gone far
enough. Most likely he knew at once to
what family that other Belassis belonged, and
it was not to be wondered at if the news gave
him a new pang of terror.</p>

<p>‘Must be another family,’ he muttered
hoarsely. ‘I’ve no—no—no relations in
Yorkshire.’</p>

<p>‘No? Ah, then it is a mere coincidence.
Hardly likely to be anything more.’</p>

<p>Having wreaked some of her vengeance
upon Belassis, Miss Marjory was able to turn
her attention to the foreigner, who had now
recovered from his momentary confusion.</p>

<p>It was he who opened the conversation, and
he seemed inclined to be aggressive.</p>

<p>‘Madame has done me the honour to doubt
my word. Will Madame tell me her reason?
Is it merely because I understand English,
although I cannot speak it with any fluency?
Surely there are many in a like case.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>‘I dare say there are; but I have other
reasons for what I said,’ answered Miss Marjory
boldly, on the ‘nothing-venture, nothing-have’
principle, going a good deal farther than
she had any warrant. ‘I know more about
you than you think.’</p>

<p>A look of uneasiness flitted across the
young man’s face, which his bland smile did
not disguise.</p>

<p>‘Madame is mysterious. May I not hear
what it is that you have learned of me?’</p>

<p>‘I’m not sure that you may,’ answered
Miss Marjory, wondering how far she had
better go.</p>

<p>‘My curiosity is burning,’ he went on in a
low eager tone. ‘Madame is cruel to make
accusations which she will not substantiate.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>‘What accusations have I made?’</p>

<p>He hesitated somewhat, and then said:</p>

<p>‘You tell me I am not what I seem to be.’</p>

<p>‘Well, can you look me in the face, and tell
me that you are?’</p>

<p>Signor Pagliadini did not even attempt to
do this. He merely said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>‘That is a grave charge to bring against a
man.’</p>

<p>‘If it comes to that,’ retorted Miss Marjory
boldly, ‘I could bring a graver one if I
chose.’</p>

<p>‘Will you explain farther?’</p>

<p>‘I am not sure that I will; but I don’t
mind telling you that you are playing a risky
game, and may get yourself into trouble one
of these days.’</p>

<p>‘How so?’</p>

<p>He looked so ill at ease that Miss Marjory
felt her attempt to frighten him had been unexpectedly
successful.</p>

<p>‘You have come here bent on mischief;
you know that as well as I do. You won’t
succeed in what you mean to do, and you
stand a good chance of finding yourself in a
very unpleasant position.’</p>

<p>He gazed at her with an earnestness and
anxiety which told her that her words had
produced an impression. She had not chosen
them with any special care. Her object had
been, if possible, to alarm him, and induce
him to keep as quiet as he would on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
subject of the secret he had discovered. From
the expression his face had assumed, she
imagined that her random shaft had struck
home.</p>

<p>‘He is not very bold,’ she thought. ‘I
must make him nervous.’</p>

<p>‘I have not come bent on mischief,
Madame,’ he answered gravely, but not
timidly. ‘Madame is in error there. I have
come to put right a wrong—that is all—to do
justice to the helpless and oppressed. If
Madame knew all that I do, she would not
speak as she now does.’</p>

<p>‘I imagine I know a great deal more than
you do, Signor,’ answered Miss Marjory
severely; ‘and I am sure I know a great deal
more than you think. I know pretty well
what idea you have got in your head, and it is
entirely wrong. My friend and our host, Mr.
Philip Debenham, is the soul of honour. You
do not and you cannot understand him. I will
give you this assurance, and also this warning.
Do not attempt to carry out this plan of yours,
for you will never be able to do it. Give it
up with a good grace whilst there is yet time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
and do not bring upon yourself the ignominy
of defeat.’</p>

<p>The dark face looked more dark than ever—more
in bewilderment, it seemed, than in
anger.</p>

<p>‘Who will defeat me?’ he asked slowly.</p>

<p>‘I will!’ answered Miss Marjory, with all
the reckless daring of her nature.</p>

<p>‘You!’ he echoed, looking very hard at her.
‘Why, what can you do?’</p>

<p>‘I can generally do anything I have a mind
to,’ answered Miss Marjory significantly.
‘You had better not make an enemy of me.’</p>

<p>He still looked hard at her—as if he would
read her very soul.</p>

<p>‘And you are a staunch supporter of—of—our
host—of Philip Debenham’s?’</p>

<p>‘I am,’ she answered coolly; ‘and I am as
firm a friend as I am an enemy. Any cause
I take up generally prospers.’</p>

<p>Maud’s health was now being proposed, and
all private conversation had suddenly to be
suspended; but when Miss Marjory sailed
away with the other ladies into the drawing-room,
it was with the comfortable assurance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
that she had made profitable use of her time,
and had given Signor Pagliadini a good
scare.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory had enjoyed the dinner-party,
if nobody else had.</p>

 <p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">hen</span> the ladies left the dinner-table
for the drawing-room, some of the
old constraint seemed to fall upon
the party.</p>

<p>It was not easy for anyone bearing the
name of Belassis, to be thoroughly comfortable
at Ladywell under existing circumstances.
Matilda and Bertha were in constant dread
of what their mother might say or do next;
and she, on her part, was in a state of suppressed
restlessness and irritation, which she
found very hard to bear.</p>

<p>She had not heard what it was that passed
between her husband and Miss Marjory at
the dinner-table; but she felt convinced that
there was some secret from which she was
excluded, and she would gladly have questioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
the guest from Whitbury, and elicited
from her the desired information.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory, however, had no disposition
to be pumped by Mrs. Belassis—no inclination,
in fact, for any intercourse whatever with
her. If anything occurred which should make
it desirable for her to be told of her husband’s
former marriage, Miss Marjory was quite prepared
to make the necessary communication;
but then, she would make it after her own
fashion, and in her own words: she had no
notion of being questioned or cross-examined.
She was perfectly aware that Mrs. Belassis
was anxious to obtain a few minutes’ private
conversation, and equally determined not to
permit such an interview to take place.</p>

<p>It may, under exceptional circumstances, be
possible to catch a weasel asleep; but under
no circumstances whatsoever, waking or sleeping,
was Miss Marjory to be caught if she did
not intend to be.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis soon gave up the attempt as
hopeless, yet she had not the least idea that
her manœuvres had been observed.</p>

<p>It was not long before the gentlemen joined
them in the drawing-room. Tor’s face was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
somewhat grave; the Signor looked flushed
and indignant. Lewis seemed nervous and
preoccupied; Belassis the same, only to a
greater extent.</p>

<p>Instructed beforehand by his wife (he did
not himself fully understand why), he had
started inquiries respecting Mr. Torwood, and
Signor Pagliadini had taken up the subject
with great zeal, and put the most searching
questions to their host.</p>

<p>The two Belassis’, father and son, had too
much upon their minds to take great interest
in what passed, and, indeed, a good deal of
it was beyond their power of comprehension;
but it was evident that the Italian had become
excited, and that the coolness and imperturbability
of their host had annoyed him
more than a little.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory saw at a glance that something
had occurred, and took advantage of a
noisy moment to say in a low voice:</p>

<p>‘Has anything happened? Has he made
himself disagreeable? I thought I had pretty
well silenced him.’</p>

<p>Tor could not but smile, as he answered:</p>

<p>‘I thought you must have been talking to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
him. He seemed as if he had been driven to
desperation.’</p>

<p>‘Desperate, is he?’ questioned Miss Marjory
briskly. ‘How very amusing! I must certainly
see what can be done for him. Mind
you ask him here for a few days. I think it
is time he was brought under our jurisdiction.
I will keep an eye upon him, when once we
get him to Ladywell.’</p>

<p>‘I will ask him, certainly. Whether he will
come, is a different matter.’</p>

<p>‘You have not quarrelled, have you?’</p>

<p>‘No; but he nearly lost his temper. He
does not, I am sure, feel anything but enmity
towards me. He may not care to become my
guest.’</p>

<p>‘And how do you feel?’</p>

<p>‘Strange to say, I can’t help liking him,
though he is so troublesome. I’m sure I
have never known him under his present
name, but I am equally sure that I have
known him and liked him at some time or
other, and I can’t shake off the old feeling of
liking. I suppose he was some old chum of—of—Tor’s,
you know. When he comes
back, I dare say it will be all clear.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>There was no time for private conference
now. People were looking impatiently at
Tor, as if to suggest that he should institute
the needful formalities.</p>

<p>‘I think,’ said he, speaking generally to the
company, ‘that we had better adjourn to the
library whilst the matter that has brought us
together to-day is discussed.’</p>

<p>Then, as there was a general move towards
the door, Tor said, turning to the Italian:</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid this next half-hour will be but
a dull one for you—it is merely some family
matter that has to be settled and discussed.
No doubt you would rather smoke your cigar
upon the terrace. I will join you there as
soon as I can.’</p>

<p>‘You are very good, but I do not care for
solitude and smoke,’ answered the Signor. ‘If
I am not intruding, I should be much more
interested by listening to Mademoiselle’s decision.
I have heard from Miss Meredith
what is the nature of this family gathering.’</p>

<p>Tor thought this showed a very fair assurance
on the part of a stranger, but there was
not time to argue the point now.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur must please himself,’ he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
coldly; ‘but all the conversation will be in
English, and it is of a nature which cannot
possibly interest a stranger.’</p>

<p>As Miss Marjory was to be present, by her
own and Maud’s special wish, he could not
say that only the family could be admitted;
so the Signor, with something like mockery
in his smile and bow, followed Tor into the
library.</p>

<p>Maud lifted her eyebrows as she saw him
enter; but she had rather a liking for the
handsome Italian, and was more surprised
than annoyed by his appearance.</p>

<p>She was seated in a prominent position in
the great room, and looked quite equal to the
occasion. A flush was on her cheek, and a
light in her eyes which added greatly to her
attractions, and Tor looked at her with an
admiring pride.</p>

<p>He had never asked her, in so many words,
what her decision was going to be; but he
knew it nevertheless. He knew she could never
have been so proud, so gay, so self-possessed,
had she been about to surrender her life and
her future into the hands of Lewis Belassis—to
sell herself in a loveless marriage!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>There was an unbroken silence in the
room.</p>

<p>‘Uncle Belassis,’ said Tor, courteously and
coldly, ‘I believe it is your place, as executor
and legal adviser of our late father,
Philip Debenham, and as guardian of my
sister during her minority, to read the will
now in your possession, and any other documents
you may have, which bear upon the
present question.’</p>

<p>He pulled forward, and placed at the head
of the table, a heavy leather-covered chair,
and Mr. Belassis came forward, with all the
dignity he could assume, and sat down facing
the whole company. He placed his papers
upon the table, and tried to cover his nervous
embarrassment by a pompous air of importance,
which was peculiarly difficult for him to
assume in Miss Marjory’s presence.</p>

<p>Maud signed to Tor to come and sit beside
her. She was quite able to stand alone, but
she felt as if her brother was in himself a
tower of strength, and she liked to feel him
near.</p>

<p>Mr. Belassis unfolded his document, and,
after a few preliminary remarks, in which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
spoke much of his dearly beloved and
honoured friend and brother, Philip Debenham,
and his most dear niece, towards whom
he had always felt like a father, and played,
as far as was permitted him, a father’s part,
he proceeded to read such portion of the late
Philip Debenham’s will as referred to the inheritance
of his daughter.</p>

<p>Everyone present was perfectly aware of the
condition imposed, before the money which
had been his wife’s could pass to his daughter;
but yet, when the words were really read,
which willed away two thirds of a large
fortune from his own child to his wife’s
nephew, simply because she might refuse to
become his wife, a murmur of mingled distrust
and indignation seemed to go round the
assembled company; and, in the silence that
followed, Mrs. Lorraine’s quiet voice was distinctly
heard, saying with distressful earnestness:</p>

<p>‘My poor, dear, loving brother never, never
could have made such a will! He loved his
children too well. He was too noble, too
good, too just! Oh, there is something very,
very wrong in it all!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>‘Silence, Olive! for shame!’ interposed
Mrs. Belassis sternly. ‘You forget yourself
strangely.’</p>

<p>Tor’s eyes flashed a look at Mrs. Belassis,
which it was perhaps as well for her peace of
mind that she did not see. He rose, and
crossed over towards where the two sisters
were sitting.</p>

<p>‘Pardon me, Mrs. Belassis,’ he said; ‘but
so long as Mrs. Lorraine honours me by her
presence in my house, it is my place to shield
her from insult. She has full liberty to speak
her mind freely on this and all other subjects.
No one in the world has the right to bid her
be silent, least of all in my house. Aunt Olive,
I think Maud would like to have you beside
her. Let me give you my arm across the
room.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis glared at him with an expression
of vindictive malice, not often so openly
displayed in polite society.</p>

<p>‘You shall rue this bitterly, Philip Debenham!’
she hissed, in a whisper which only he
and Mrs. Lorraine could hear. ‘You shall
have good cause to know that I am not to be
insulted with impunity.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>Tor smiled and bowed in his haughty careless
fashion, and led Mrs. Lorraine away.</p>

<p>All this had passed so rapidly, that people
were yet exchanging whispered comments
upon the wording of the strange will.</p>

<p>Miss Marjory, of course, had plenty to say,
and it was not her custom to whisper.</p>

<p>‘It’s the most ridiculous will I ever heard
in my life!’ she exclaimed, with an emphatic
gesture of contempt. ‘It’s positively
idiotic! People are very odd, and there’s no accounting
for tastes; but really this is beyond
everything. Philip Debenham, I believe you
could get the whole thing upset in a court of
law. The man must have been mad when he
drew it up. I should dispute it if I were
you.’</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Belassis looked pinched and
blue, despite the warmness of the evening.
The Signor seemed listening with the most
profound interest to every word that was
spoken.</p>

<p>Maud gave Tor a look of half-impatient
entreaty, and he interposed to say to Belassis:</p>

<p>‘Have you anything more to add, before
my sister registers her decision?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>‘I have a letter written by her dear dead
father, whom that lady has thought fit——’
Here Miss Marjory turned suddenly round
and looked him full in the face. The effect
was instantaneous. The words died away
into silence, and he concluded feebly enough:
‘A letter to Maud—from her father. Will
you read it, my dear?’</p>

<p>‘I see,’ said Tor, ‘that it is neither sealed
nor fastened. No doubt you are master of its
contents. I think it would be better that you
should read it to us. Is that your wish, Maud?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she answered readily. ‘I would
rather it was read aloud.’</p>

<p>Belassis had no choice but to obey. Perhaps
he did not object to the task. The letter
might possibly convince the company that the
will did but embody the real wishes of Philip
Debenham, senior.</p>

<p>He cleared his throat, and began:</p>

<p>
‘<span class="smcap">My dear and only Daughter</span>,’<br >
</p>

<p>(‘As if papa would ever have begun a letter
like that!’ breathed Maud indignantly.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>‘When this reaches your hand, you will
have been made aware of my dearest wish for
your future—a wish that has been near my
heart for many long years, and which will, I
am convinced, secure at once the happiness
and well-being of your future life. I mean
by this, your marriage with the son of my
dearest and most faithful friend, Alfred Belassis.
I cannot doubt that the son of such a father
will grow up to resemble him; and I feel that
I am doing the best that can be done for your
future, as well as gratifying my own earnest
wish, when I try to do that which will make
you a happy woman for life. When your name
is Belassis I shall not know an ungratified
wish; and if, as is probable, I shall not live
to see the day on which your choice is made,
you will know that by consenting to a marriage
with your cousin, you will be at once
securing to yourself the fortune which I have
conditionally left to you, and doing that
which has been, and always will be, the most
sincere wish of your affectionate father,</p>

<p>
‘<span class="smcap">Philip Debenham</span>.’<br >
</p>
</div>

<p>Dead silence followed the reading of this
elegantly worded epistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>Philip Debenham had been a man of high
culture and refined scholarly tastes. His letters
had been models of the art of diction. Anything
clumsy in construction, or faulty in expression,
had certainly never issued from his
pen; and anyone who had ever known him in
his lifetime, or had even known what manner
of man he was, must be convinced that whether
or not that letter was written by himself, its
contents had never been composed by him.</p>

<p>The prolonged silence occasioned Belassis
a feeling of discomfort he hardly understood.
He broke it himself, by turning to Maud with
a smile meant to be insinuating and paternal.</p>

<p>‘There, my dear girl, you hear now what was
the real wish of your dear father. May I hope
that his wishes will be carried out by you, and
that I shall soon have the happiness of welcoming
you as a daughter?’</p>

<p>Maud’s eyes glowed with a strange light.
Dim remembrances of her dead father had
risen up within her, and she felt a burning
indignation against anyone who could so have
abused his confidence and exercised so great
a power over him.</p>

<p>She rose and spoke with a firmness which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
showed that she was actuated by no mere
girlish caprice.</p>

<p>‘My decision was made long ago, Uncle
Belassis; but even had it not been, what I
have now heard would have settled the matter.
My father never wrote that letter, except at your
dictation. He only made that will under your
coercion. I know it as well as possible, in spite
of anything you may choose to say. Uncle
Belassis, I will never marry your son; and I
will never call you uncle again; you have
been a false friend, a cruel guardian, and a
dishonest man. I have made my decision, and
you hear it now. I will lose the money. I will
not marry any son of yours. Philip will take
care of me. He will be my guardian as well
as my brother now.’</p>

<p>She turned to him with a proud and loving
look; and he stood up beside her, and drew
her hand within his arm. It was a quiet but
significant gesture, and Maud looked up in his
face with a smile.</p>

<p>Then she turned to Lewis, and held out her
other hand.</p>

<p>‘Lewis,’ she said, ‘you know I like you. I
am sorry I cannot like you better. It is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
your fault that you are a Belassis—you are
not a bit like one; and I am very sorry for
you. I am glad you will be rich, anyway,
and we will always be friends.’</p>

<p>But the conclave was not over yet. Miss
Marjory’s tongue could never be silent in
moments of excitement, and now that she had
held her peace as long as it was possible to
do so, she burst out again.</p>

<p>‘It’s the most infamous conspiracy I ever
heard of—as clear a case of coercion as ever
was brought into a court of law. Will!
letter! Stuff and nonsense! I believe the
whole thing is a great forgery!’</p>

<p>Belassis looked furious; but he dared not
fly out at Miss Marjory.</p>

<p>‘Anybody is welcome to examine them;
they are absolutely genuine—will and letter
both. Who knows Philip Debenham’s handwriting
and signature? I appeal to them.’</p>

<p>But Miss Marjory paid no heed to him.
She had flown back to her former train of
thought.</p>

<p>‘Philip Debenham, you must dispute that
will. If there is any equity in law, you can
get it reversed as easily as possible. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
could not be a clearer case of bribery and
corruption, or whatever they call it—at least
of coercion and fraud. Anyone with half an
eye could see exactly how it had all happened.
You have as good a case, I should say, as a
man could wish. Take counsel’s opinion at
once, and act accordingly. I should dispute
that will to the death, if I were you.’</p>

<p>‘There will be no need to do that,’ said
Lewis, coming forward and speaking for the
first time, ‘for I decline to take advantage of
it. I am convinced, like other people, that
there is something odd about that condition.
Anyway, it is a very unjust one. When the
money comes to me, I shall make it over to
Maud. I should be ashamed to live upon her
fortune.’</p>

<p>Miss Marjory jumped up, and shook him by
the hand.</p>

<p>‘Spoken like a man!’ she said with approbation.
‘You are no Belassis, young man, in
spite of your name. I have a great respect
for your character from this moment.’</p>

<p>‘No—no, Lewis,’ interposed Maud. ‘The
money is yours, and you must have it. I
think I am rather glad for you to have something.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
You must not make it over to
me.’</p>

<p>‘If you do, you idiot of a boy,’ growled
Belassis, whose face was purple, ‘I’ll cut you
off with a shilling! I’ll turn you out of my
house—I’ll make a beggar of you before a week
is over!’</p>

<p>‘I think I’d as soon be a beggar, as loafing
round at home doing nothing,’ remarked Lewis
slowly. ‘I dare say if I tried I could get
some sort of a berth. I’m not such a fool as
I look.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll help you!’ cried Miss Marjory eagerly—‘I’ll
stand your friend. I’ll soon find something
you can do. I like to see a man who
wishes to be independent. Don’t be downhearted.
Trust to me.’</p>

<p>‘And to me,’ said Tor, ‘if you take a step
like that. I’ll try to ensure that you never
repent it.’</p>

<p>Belassis looked daggers at his son, and
would have spoken again, but that his wife,
who had crossed the room during the confusion,
laid a warning hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>‘Say no more now. Lewis is a mere baby;
but he is obstinate, and will only commit himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
deeper and deeper if you oppose him now.
We will soon take the nonsense out of him
when we have him alone.’</p>

<p>‘He <i>must</i> not do it—it would ruin us!’
gasped Belassis helplessly.</p>

<p>‘He shall not do it. I will take care of it.
Now come, don’t give way, or play the fool.
Quite enough odium and contempt has fallen
to our share to-day, without your adding to
the burden by your cowardice. We had
better get away as fast as we can, or that
hateful little yellow woman will be making
fresh discoveries.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sure I don’t want to stay,’ groaned
her husband, with evident sincerity. ‘It’s
the most awful evening I’ve ever spent in
my life. Let’s get up and go. I’ll tell them
that I’ll not stay here to be insulted any
longer.’</p>

<p>He tried to assume his dignified air, but
was promptly snubbed by his wife.</p>

<p>‘You’ll do no such thing! You’ll just sit
there till I make the move! We’ve had quite
enough of your muddling for one evening!’</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis spoke viciously, because she
felt vicious, not because she had any special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
grudge against her husband at this particular
moment.</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered round in search of one
face, and when her glance encountered that of
Signor Pagliadini, something like a magnetic
attraction seemed to draw the two into an
isolated corner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belassis was furious. The last link
which bound her to a peaceable policy was
now snapped asunder, and she was eager to
declare war at all hazards. She was still
greatly in the dark as to how the onslaught
could be made; but she knew that her nephew
could be attacked with advantage in some
quarter or other, and that the Italian knew
better than she did how to plan the campaign.
Desperation gave her boldness.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur,’ she began, in a vigorous
whisper, ‘does it not seem to you time to
put an end to this game?’</p>

<p>‘High time!’ he answered gloomily.</p>

<p>‘If we do not bestir ourselves,’ continued
she, feeling her way so as to lead him as far
as possible to commit himself, ‘things will
have got beyond our power. We must not
let them go too far.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>A very sombre light glowed in the handsome
eyes of the stranger.</p>

<p>‘I agree entirely with Madame.’</p>

<p>She looked eagerly at him.</p>

<p>‘Are you prepared, then, to act?’</p>

<p>After a momentary hesitation, he answered:</p>

<p>‘I believe I am.’</p>

<p>‘And I,’ said she, ‘will assist you.’</p>

<p>He did not respond warmly to this generous
offer; but Mrs. Belassis would not be discouraged.</p>

<p>‘Two heads, you know, Monsieur, are better
than one!’</p>

<p>‘Madame is right.’</p>

<p>‘And I am not an ally to be despised.
I know much of all the history of the
family.’</p>

<p>‘True—very true!’ he seemed to reflect.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps, Madame, we had better meet somewhere
soon, where we can discuss this difficult
question.’</p>

<p>‘To-morrow, then,’ she answered eagerly.
‘Meet me to-morrow by that fallen tree, where
we talked before. At eleven o’clock I will be
there. Do not forget.’</p>

<p>‘I will not,’ he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>But this appointment with Mrs. Belassis
did not hinder him from accepting with
alacrity Tor’s invitation to pay a short visit
to Ladywell; and two days later was fixed
as the date when he might commence his
sojourn there.</p>

<p>‘That man and Mrs. Belassis,’ remarked
Miss Marjory, as she watched the departure of
the company—‘mark my word, that man and
Mrs. Belassis mean mischief!’</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
